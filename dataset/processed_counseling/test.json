You mentioned that you feel like you serve no purpose and that your brain barely works and your memory is small. These are symptoms that may be related to depression or cognitive decline. However, it's important to note that there are effective treatments for both.  Regarding your question about why you continue to exist, it's essential to recognize that the meaning we give to our lives is largely a matter of perspective. It's normal to feel lost and unsure at times, especially when we're facing challenges. However, it's important to remember that we are not defined by our current circumstances or feelings. You mentioned that you have agoraphobia and that you cannot leave your town. It might be helpful to explore ways to improve your quality of life where you are. This could involve seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, or finding Meaningful activities that you can engage in despite your limitations.  Regarding the question about God's intention for your existence, it's important to remember that this is a deeply personal and subjective question. Many people find meaning and purpose in their lives through their spiritual or religious beliefs. If this is something that resonates with you, it might be helpful to explore that avenue. However, it's also worth considering that meaning and purpose can be found in the everyday moments of life, such as connections with others, personal growth, or contributing to the world in any way that you can.  Lastly, I want to emphasize the importance of reaching out for help when you're feeling overwhelmed. You mentioned that you feel like a waste of time and resources, but it's essential to remember that seeking help is an investment in your own well-being and can ultimately lead to greater fulfillment and satisfaction in life. If you're not already doing so, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a support group for further guidance and understanding.",

If anything, I want to commend you on the self-respect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it.  One of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others; while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you - they don't see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective. It's important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals.  Once you stop comparing your happiness, you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down. ",

It's natural to want your partner's support, especially during a time like this. Your emotions are valid.  Your parents may have their reasons for restricting your communication with your boyfriend, but it's essential to remember that as a soon-to-be mother, your needs and feelings matter. Open communication and support from both sides of the family are crucial for the health and wellbeing of you and your baby.  I recommend sitting down with your parents and having an open and respectful conversation about your feelings. Share how their decision is affecting you and express your desire to have some autonomy in this situation.

You are not wrong for wanting him around, but communication and understanding from your parents are necessary to make this happen.

It's important to remember that everyone experiences rejection and disappointment, especially in relationships. It's not uncommon to have thoughts of inadequacy or unworthiness, but they're often not an accurate reflection of reality.  First, please know that it's okay to have these feelings and it's okay to seek help. You're taking the brave step of reaching out for support, which is a great first step.  Now, let's explore some ways to improve your relationships and your sense of self-worth:  1. Identify your negative thought patterns: Try to observe your thinking when you start feeling down about yourself. Are there any recurring negative thoughts? Identify these thought patterns and challenge them with evidence of your strengths and positive experiences. 2. Practice self-care: Make sure you're taking good care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Make time for activities you enjoy, eat well, get enough sleep, and engage in relaxation techniques. 3. Seek validation from positive relationships: Surround yourself with people who love and appreciate you for who you are. Cultivate these relationships and don't focus too much on the ones that aren't going well. 4. Challenge your limiting beliefs: Consider where your feelings of unworthiness and being unlovable come from. Are they based on actual experiences or just generalizations? Challenge these thoughts by reminding yourself of the things you're good at and the things people value about you. 5. Seek support: Reach out to a therapist, friends, and family if you need help processing your feelings and improving your relationships. Don't let pride or embarrassment stand in the way of getting the help you need.  Remember, it's a normal part of life to experience rejection and feelings of inadequacy. But don't let these feelings define you or your worth. Instead, focus on all the positive things about yourself and the beauty and potential that exists within you.",

However, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries that promote healthier relationships. Here are some steps you could consider:  1. Self-reflection: Understand the patterns and motivations behind getting into such relationships. Are you subconsciously seeking to help or save someone, or is it an emotional need for validation?  2. Set limits: Before getting involved with someone, take some time to assess their situation and evaluate whether it's a relationship you want to invest your time and energy into.  3. Prioritize self-care: Focus on nurturing your own physical, emotional, and mental health by engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.  4. Learn from past experiences: Reflect on the lessons learned from previous relationships and use this knowledge to make more informed decisions.  5. Seek out healthy relationships: Instead of getting involved with people in bad situations, consider developing relationships with individuals who are emotionally and mentally stable.  6. Practice mindfulness: Be aware of your emotions and thought patterns when you come across someone in need. Practice active listening and respond from a place of compassion, rather than jumping in to rescue or fix.  7. Seek outside support: Consider seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor to help navigate the underlying emotional causes behind your pattern of getting into relationships with men in distress.  Remember, helping from a distance or providing guidance can be just as meaningful and fulfilling as being directly involved in someone's life.

In a nutshell, this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have. Typically, there is an element of fear, danger or helplessness.Second, we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment, control, competence, and/or safety. In other words, if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted, we might change the events of the story so that you call the police, get to a place of safety, or even fight back and protect yourself.Third, you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again, so that it becomes a well rehearsed story. The effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping, this new, more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream.

However, it's important to remember that a few negative experiences do not define your worth as a person or a professional. I would recommend exploring the underlying causes of your performance issues and your depression.  Have you considered speaking with a therapist or counselor about your thoughts and feelings related to these experiences? They can help you identify any negative thought patterns or beliefs that may be contributing to your anxiety and depression during job interviews. Additionally, it may be helpful to practice relaxation techniques and positive self-talk before and during interviews to help manage stress and improve self-confidence.  It's also essential to recognize that job interviews are not the only way to secure employment or provide for your family. Have you considered pursuing other employment opportunities, such as freelance or remote work, or even starting your own business? These options may offer more flexibility and control over your career trajectory, which could be beneficial for your mental health and wellbeing.  Ultimately, it's crucial to focus on your strengths and resilience rather than past failures or rejections, and to take a proactive approach to improving your situation rather than feeling stuck and helpless. It's okay to ask for help and support when you need it, and there are resources and allies available to help you on this journey towards greater self-confidence and professional success.",

It's a type of anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear or anxiety about social situations, where you may feel embarrassed, judged, or criticized. These feelings can be quite distressing and can make it difficult for you to attend social events or even leave your home. I'd recommend trying some self-help strategies to manage your social anxiety. For instance, you could practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation. Exposure therapy, which involves gradually facing your fears in a controlled and supported environment, can also be effective. You could start with small social situations, such as speaking to a trusted friend or joining a small group activity, and gradually work your way up to more challenging situations. Lastly, consider reaching out to a mental health professional, as they can offer valuable guidance and support. While therapy can be expensive, there are often free or low-cost resources available, such as support groups or community mental health clinics.

Humans are social creatures who were created to be in connection with others, but sometimes our life experiences or genetics can make that more difficult for some of us. It is possible that these reactions are based on negative reactions you have had with others in the past, maybe your family, or other traumatic interactions with others. It is also possible that they are caused by an underlying condition such as anxiety or depression, which may cause you to be more uncomfortable around others or annoyed by others. Some people are also more bothered by crowded spaces, loud interactions, and the actions of others. Of course you prefer animals (me too!), they provide unconditional love and support, do not judge you, and do not require you to have conversations with them. The fact that you have conversations in your head at night tells me that although you say you do not like people, you are craving some social connection.

Sleep problems, including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about, are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changed or started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication, talk to your provider about the nightmares, this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense, but then again even good dreams don't always make much sense. Ask yourself, do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work, school, relationships, health.... all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up \"Guided Meditation for Sleep\" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are self-help ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search \"Nightmare Rescripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

Based on what you've shared, it appears that your husband acted in a deceptive and dishonest manner. The fact that he initially lied to you about his whereabouts and then later disclosed that he stayed with his ex-wife, even when he knew you were aware, indicates a breach of trust.  Regarding your specific question, infidelity often involves physical intimacy, but it's important to remember that emotional intimacy can also be damaging to a relationship, especially when it's hidden from a partner.

There are a few reasons why this might be the case:  First, changing behaviors and habits can be difficult because they often involve overcoming ingrained patterns and unhelpful thought processes. These patterns can be deeply ingrained and can take time and effort to change.  Second, making changes can be scary and uncomfortable. It's natural to want to stay in our comfort zones, even if they're not serving us well. This fear can prevent us from taking action and making changes.  Third, sometimes external circumstances or stressors can make it difficult to make changes. For example, if you're dealing with a lot of stress or anxiety, it can be difficult to focus on making changes in your life.  To help overcome these challenges, it can be helpful to start small and set realistic goals. Break down larger changes into smaller, manageable steps. Surround yourself with supportive people who believe in your ability to make changes and can offer encouragement and guidance. And finally, be kind to yourself throughout the process.

Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, \"I want to be more confident\" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help.

Here are a few suggestions:  1. Communication: Maintain regular communication with your partner. Keep in touch as often as possible. Make use of technology to ensure you can talk, text, or video call regularly.  2. Trust: Trust is the foundation of any relationship, and it can be hard to build and maintain in long-distance relationships. Believe in your partner's commitment to you, and remember that you also need to be committed to maintaining the relationship.  3. Patience and Understanding: Understand that military life can be unpredictable, and there may be times when your partner is unreachable due to mission requirements or deployments. Be patient and understanding during these times.  4. Creative Date Nights: Plan some creative date nights to keep the connection alive. This could be a movie night where you watch a movie at the same time over video call, a virtual game night, or even planning a surprise care package for your partner.  5. Seek Support: It's important to remember that you're not alone in this situation. Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if you need help dealing with the emotions and stress of a long-distance relationship. Remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

For example, \"I feel unheard when we don't have a chance to discuss my day,\" instead of, \"You never listen to me.\"  3. Use active listening skills: Make sure you are fully present when your husband speaks and show that you are engaged by summarizing what he says and asking clarifying questions. This will model the listening behavior you want to see from him.  4. Check your tone and body language: Nonverbal cues can be powerful in communication. Make sure your tone is warm and your body language shows that you are genuinely interested in what he has to say.  5. Try reflective listening: This involves repeating back what you heard your spouse say in your own words to show that you have truly heard and understood their perspective. This can be a powerful tool to build understanding and connection.  6. Practice empathy: Try to understand your husband's perspective, even if it differs from yours.

Stay calm and compassionate: It's important to approach the conversation with a calm and compassionate attitude to promote productive communication.

It is as if we lack the language, the words to define it and the skills to practice it.Putting up with a loved one's drug addiction, their infidelity, lack of respect and esteem, verbal and physical abuse, tend to show and reflect the degree of our lack of self esteem, lack of sense of self worth, lack of belief that we are worth and deserve more from life.Separating was the first step towards reversing this negative situation.

I like your healthy boundaries, and I'll help you explore possible ways to respond to her. First, she hasn't asked yet, and you don't know that she will. Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. They're not hurting you and if you ignore them, they're more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if she's offended, that doesn't mean that you're being mean; it means that she has unrealistic expectations. So, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. You might never have to face that moment. But, I understand that you want to be prepared.As her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. Is he willing to do this? But if you are comfortable, and if you're the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it won't happen. And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying \"but maybe later\". No need to apologize or hum and haw...\"We love that you want to be around Junior, and we definitely want you in his/her life. (try to leave out the \"but\" here). You're not in a healthy place, and we're not comfortable with you caring for him/her on your own.\"If she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. I'd let her know that it's not negotiable, that you understand if she's disappointed, but you're not open to discussing the issue. Really, there's nothing to discuss.

You can suggest that he speaks to a therapist, counselor, or trusted adult to better understand the emotions he's experiencing and develop coping strategies.  Show empathy and offer practical support in whatever way you can. Offer to help him with errands or tasks, cook a meal for him, or engage in activities that he enjoys to help him take his mind off his heartbreak. You can also suggest distraction techniques such as reading, listening to music, or engaging in hobbies to help him cope.  Remind him of his strengths and past successes, emphasizing that he has the capacity to love again and recover from this heartbreak. You can also help him reframe his thoughts about his value and worth, reminding him that being in a relationship doesn't define his worth as a person.  Finally, reassure him of your support and friendship, making it clear that you're there for him through the heartbreak and beyond. Encourage him to communicate openly with you, and create a judgment-free and emotionally safe space for him to do so. Remember, healing takes time, so be patient and understanding with him during this process.",

        "text": "Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.",

However, it seems that your partner may not be open to discussing the issues at the moment. In such cases, I would suggest trying alternative methods to express your feelings and concerns.  You could write him a letter, use arts as an expression medium, or seek the help of a couples therapist to mediate the conversation. Remember, the goal is not to force him to talk, but to effectively convey your concerns and express your love and dedication to the relationship.  Additionally, you could focus on your personal growth, as self-improvement and increased self-confidence can often lead to an improved relationship dynamic. Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally, and consider joining a support group, such as a therapy group, to share your experiences and receive guidance from professionals and others in similar situations.  Lastly, be patient and understanding. Change takes time, and it may be a gradual process for both you and your partner to reconnect and strengthen your relationship. Continue expressing your love and support, but be mindful of not pushing too hard, as this may push your partner further away.

When we are in relationships, trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship.  Often, when we feel we are required to prove ourselves, feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive.  In situations like this, I often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner.  Your fears about his response are valid, as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them.  You can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses.  In the end, these are issues that you cannot conquer for him - you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust.  You may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to, as well.

Sometimes, the initial butterflies we feel in the early stages of a relationship can be intense, but they may not last. In contrast, deeper connections based on mutual respect, understanding, and trust can grow stronger as the relationship progresses.  Consider communicating your feelings honestly with both partners. Be open about the emotions you're experiencing and the uncertainties you face. This can be a challenging conversation, but being clear and straightforward can help all involved parties make informed decisions and potentially strengthen bonds.  In the end, only you can make the decision that's right for you.

In terms of dealing with the bullying, it's essential to remember that the opinions of others do not define you.

Consider reaching out to trusted adults, such as teachers, counselors, or other school staff, to discuss your experiences with bullying. They may be able to provide additional support and resources.  Regarding your parents, it's important to remember that their perspective might not align with yours. It's understandable that they may not see your struggles the way you do, but their denial of your feelings can make it challenging for you to seek help. If your parents are resistant to getting you therapy, consider alternative sources of support such as online communities, books, or self-help resources.

Your fianc\u00e9e's symptoms sound consistent with anxiety and depressive disorders, and it's not uncommon for people with these conditions to experience avoidance, fear, and difficulty functioning in public places, as well as intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and even suicidal ideation.  I do want to acknowledge your concerns about medication. While medication can be an effective treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders, it's important to remember that it's not the only option. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based therapies, can be highly effective in helping people manage these conditions. These therapies can help people learn and practice skills to reduce anxiety, improve mood, and cope with challenging situations.  As you've noticed, your fianc\u00e9e seems to derive some relief from the presence of her dog. Service dogs and emotional support animals can be valuable resources for people managing anxiety and depression, as they can provide companionship, comfort, and distraction. Before obtaining a service dog, I would recommend exploring other options, such as seeking out a mental health professional who specializes in treating anxiety and depression, and trying out various therapies and techniques to see what works best for your fianc\u00e9e. This might include CBT, mindfulness practices, exposure therapy, and other evidence-based treatments.  It's also important to consider other supports and accommodations that might help your fianc\u00e9e manage her symptoms in public places, such as asking for accommodations when shopping or using the restroom, carrying a portable water bottle and nutrition bars to help her stay hydrated and nourished, or using noise-cancelling headphones to help her manage sensory sensitivity.

If your anxiety interferes greatly with your ability to engage in therapy, or if it continues to worsen despite reassurance and coping strategies, it would be best to discuss this with your therapist. They may be able to suggest alternative therapy approaches or adjustments to help make the experience more comfortable for you.

The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend \"Feeling better, getting better, staying better\" by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone.",

However, it's important to remember that closure isn't always possible, especially when it comes to past relationships. The desire for closure is often driven by a need to understand the situation better and to find peace with the ending.  From what you've shared, it seems that your relationship with your ex-boyfriend was cut off suddenly due to external forces, and since then, you've been left with unanswered questions and lingering feelings. It's understandable that this is making it difficult for you to fully move on and invest in your current relationship.  However, I would encourage you to consider a few things: First, it's important to remember that your current relationship is a precious thing, and it's essential that you prioritize it. Your current boyfriend is a good person, and he deserves your full attention and commitment. If talking to your ex-boyfriend could potentially harm your current relationship, or worse, cause emotional harm to either of you, then it may be best to avoid that path.  Additionally, it's important to recognize that sometimes our minds play tricks on us. You mentioned feeling a sexual tension between you and your ex-boyfriend, but it's important to examine where that feeling is coming from. Is it based on reality, or is it more of a product of your imagination? You've indicated that they've been in an on-again, off-again relationship for over two years, and he has a girlfriend now. It's likely that your feelings towards him have changed, and it's time for you to acknowledge that.  Moving forward, it may be helpful for you to focus on the present and the beautiful things in your current relationship. You've mentioned that your current boyfriend is committed to making your life fulfilling, and that's a precious thing to have in a partner. Consider engaging in activities that bring you and your boyfriend closer together, and try to find ways to deepen your emotional connection.  Lastly, if you're having trouble letting go of the past, it may be helpful for you to explore those feelings further through journaling, therapy, or talking to trusted friends or family members.

It could be due to various reasons, such as stress, trauma, or underlying emotional problems. I would suggest exploring these possibilities further with a mental health professional, who can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatments.  In the meantime, you may find the following strategies helpful:  1. Identify triggers: What are the things, people, or situations that tend to make you angry? Avoid those triggers as much as possible. 2. Use relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation may help you calm down and reduce your anger response. 3. Practice positive thinking: Focus on the positive aspects of the situation instead of getting worked up over the negative. 4. Set realistic expectations: Don't expect perfection from yourself or others. Understand that everyone makes mistakes and that it's unrealistic to expect things to always go smoothly. 5. Seek support: Talking to a trusted friend or joining a support group may help you feel less alone and more in control. 6. Anger management techniques: There are various techniques, such as the Anger Expression Inventory or assertiveness training, that have been shown to be effective in managing anger.  Remember, it's essential to address this issue, as chronic anger can lead to health problems and other negative consequences. I encourage you to seek help from a mental health professional to better understand the root cause of your anger and develop effective coping strategies.",

It's important to note that bedwetting in adolescence is more common than many people may realize. However, if your son is consistently urinating himself during activities other than sleep, it may be worth exploring some potential underlying causes.  One possibility is an anxiety or excitement response. Video games or videos may elicit strong emotions, especially for adolescents, and this could potentially lead to an involuntary urination reflex. This is not uncommon and can sometimes be a sign of nervousness or excitement rather than a medical condition.  Another possibility is a medical issue, such as a weak bladder or a neurological condition. It's important to rule out medical causes, so I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or a pediatrician to thoroughly assess your son's situation.  Lastly, it's possible that punishment and removal of videos may not be an effective way to address this behavior, as it may not address the underlying cause. Instead, it might be more helpful to explore more positive approaches, such as implementing relaxation techniques or practicing healthy bladder habits. Please consult a mental health professional or a therapist for more guidance on how to approach this issue in a supportive and effective way.",

I would recommend reaching out to your school counselor or a mental health professional to discuss your feelings and experiences. They can help you develop strategies to cope with your emotions, improve your social connections, and address any underlying issues that might be contributing to your distress.  As far as your sleeping patterns go, it might be helpful to establish a consistent sleep schedule, limit caffeine intake, and avoid electronic devices before bedtime. These practices can help improve the quality of your sleep, which, in turn, can help improve your mood and overall well-being.

Depression is a complex condition, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in dealing with it. There are a number of approaches that can be helpful, but ultimately, the best one for you may depend on the specifics of your situation. Some people find that therapy, particularly forms like cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy, can be very helpful in learning new ways to manage their emotions and relationships. Others may find that medication can help to alleviate some of the more debilitating symptoms. Still others may find that a combination of both therapy and medication is most effective. If you're not already working with a mental health professional, I would strongly encourage you to reach out to one as soon as possible to explore these and other options. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try on your own that might help, such as getting regular physical activity, eating a healthy diet, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, getting enough sleep (including sticking to a consistent sleep schedule), practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, and engaging in activities that bring you joy or a sense of accomplishment.

I know it's hard to hear, but it's important to remember that life can be unpredictable and change is a part of the human experience.  In terms of your situation, I would suggest a few things:  1. Seek out community resources: Look for support groups in your area that focus on mental health or specific conditions like depression. These groups can offer a safe space to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. You can also try online forums or helplines if in-person meetings aren't an option. 2. Explore alternative ways to access mental health care: There are some free or low-cost mental health resources like virtual therapy sessions, hotlines, or community health clinics. Many universities or hospitals offer these services. You could also try reaching out to local faith-based organizations, as some offer counseling and support services. 3. Focus on self-care: Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This could include things like regular exercise, getting enough sleep, maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in activities you enjoy, and practicing relaxation techniques like meditation. 4. Reach out to friends or family members (reliable ones) and let them know how you feel. While it may feel difficult to ask for help, having a supportive network of people can make a world of difference. 5. Consider reaching out to organizations focused on depression and mental health advocacy. Many offer guidance, resources, and support for individuals dealing with depression.  Lastly, I understand that it may be hard to see a way out of your current situation right now, but I encourage you to keep pushing forward. Remember that things may not always be easy, but they can get better with time and effort.
