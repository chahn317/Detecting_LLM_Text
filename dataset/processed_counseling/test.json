If you haven't already read Greene's Explosive Child, you might give it a shot. While it's a little preachy, many of the tools are wonderful and can help parents navigate tantrums. https://www.amazon.com/Explosive-Child-Understanding-Frustrated-Chronically/dp/0062270451\u00a0Another tool that can redirect a child that's losing it is a task. If her tantrums, say, involve throwing things, maybe she's in charge of throwing all the sticks and acorns off the driveway into the garbage bin. Ie: 'Hey Jenny, you seem really angry right now, let's use all that energy and get some work done!' Go with her, throw with her, even - if possible - making a game out of getting the acorns into the bin from a distance.\u00a0I wish you all the best~",

The decision of whether to work through this issue and try to save the relationship is a complex one and depends on many factors. Here are some things to consider:\n\n1. The reason for the affair: Understanding the motivation behind the infidelity is crucial. Was it due to feeling neglected or unappreciated in other areas of the relationship, or was it a result of an unmet desire or need that went unfulfilled? It's important to identify the root cause of the behavior.\n\n2. Communication and trust: Effective communication and trust are essential components of any relationship. Both you and your fianc\u00e9 need to have honest and open conversations about the affair, why it happened, and what steps can be taken to rebuild trust and prevent similar situations in the future.\n\n3. Repair and forgiveness: Healing from the pain of infidelity takes time and effort from both partners. If your fianc\u00e9 genuinely takes responsibility for his actions and shows sincere remorse, there may be room for forgiveness. Forgiveness is not about excusing the behavior but rather about letting go of the resentment and moving forward.\n\n4. Professional help: Consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor to navigate this process. A professional can provide guidance on effective communication strategies, trust-building exercises, and healing techniques for both of you.\n\n5. Personal reflection: Evaluate whether the relationship is truly worth saving based on your personal values, desires, and emotional well-being. Don't make this decision solely based on fear or guilt. If you believe that the relationship has more potential for growth and happiness, consider giving it another chance. However, if you feel that you deserve better or that the relationship is no longer serving your needs, it may be best to move on.\n\nUltimately, the decision is a personal one, and it depends on your own feelings, values, and sense of what is best for you moving forward. I would encourage you to take the time to reflect on your relationship, the causes of the affair, and the actions you need to take to move forward in a manner that aligns with your authentic self and your goals for personal growth and happiness.",

Children often thrive on consistency and stability, even if their parents are divorced or living separately. Hence, frequent and meaningful contact with both parents is generally recommended, assuming the situation is safe, healthy, and mutually respectful for all parties involved.\n\nHowever, in situations where there's a great deal of animosity, manipulation, or conflict between parents, you may need to limit your contact or seek professional guidance to ensure a healthy environment for your child's development. In such cases, it's essential to prioritize your mental health as well, as children can sense their parents' emotions and may be negatively affected by ongoing conflict.\n\nIn your specific situation, if it feels confusing or detrimental to your emotional wellbeing to continue engaging with your ex, whose behavior seems manipulative, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional or a mediation service to help establish boundaries that respect your emotional needs and your child's wellbeing.\n\nRemember, focusing on moving on doesn't mean denying the past or your feelings, but rather finding a way to live your life in a healthy, meaningful way for yourself and your child.",

If your mother was a sweet and understanding lady, I am sure this change in personality feels awful! On the other hand, if your relationship with her has always been difficult this can definitely open up old wounds and anger.\u00a0I have walked alongside many families as they care for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease. It is unfortunately common to see mothers become cruel and mean toward their daughters. In your case, it sounds like she is not directing her anger at just you. While this may feel less personal, I am sure it makes finding supportive care for her very difficult. I have several quick tips that might help you cope with this situation.\u00a01. Stay tuned in to your level of anger and frustration. If you can limit the amount of time you or anyone else is with your mother you can limit the caregiver burnout. It is completely NORMAL to feel what you are feeling!! However, these are the feelings that can lead to acting out and abuse when not acknowledged. It doesn't sound like this is the case for you, but healthy boundaries and exercising respite will help with your feelings of guilt as well. So, rotate care as much as possible.2. If you find yourself arguing with your mom, STOP. Don't worry, we have all been there before. No need to feel guilty, but this only serves to agitate someone. None of us enjoys being wrong and getting into an argument. For those of us who are able to logically engage with others, sometimes this type of interaction is necessary. Alzheimer's disease has robbed your mother of her logic, therefore arguing with her will only make matters worse. Try redirecting her instead. For tips on how to do this check out Teepa Snow (teepasnow.com)3. Take care of yourself and seek support. Support groups and counseling are a great way to tend to your needs during this long journey. Caregiving can be overwhelming, lonely and heartbreaking. You don't have to go through this alone. Check out Alz.org for support groups in your area.",

Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Identify the triggers: Try to understand what makes you want to sneak out in the first place. Is it stress, loneliness, or the thrill of the unknown? Once you identify these triggers, you can start finding healthier ways to cope with them.\n2. Set achievable goals: Decide on a specific goal for why you want to stop sneaking out. It could be to improve your relationship with your parents, to focus on your studies, or to build stronger friendships in the daytime. Having clear, achievable goals can help you stay motivated.\n3. Create a plan: Come up with a detailed plan on how you can achieve your goal. This might include finding healthier ways to cope with stress or boredom, such as joining a club or hobby group, meeting new people, or finding other ways to spend your time.\n4. Share your plan with a trusted adult: It's important to be open and honest about your desire to stop sneaking out. Share your plan with someone you trust, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, and ask for their support.\n5. Practice self-care: Make sure to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. This can include getting enough sleep, eating healthy food, and engaging in regular physical activity. Good self-care can help you build the resilience and energy you'll need to make positive changes in your life.\n6. Reach out for support: If you're struggling to stop on your own, consider reaching out for additional support. This might include talking with a therapist, attending a support group, or seeking advice from a trusted adult or mentor. Remember that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n7. Take it one day at a time: Making big changes can be challenging. Focus on taking things one day at a time, and celebrate each small success along the way.

However, it's important to acknowledge that your thoughts aren't always an accurate reflection of reality. Here are some things that might help you begin to shift your perspective and feel more valued:\n\n1. Challenge negative thoughts: Negative self-talk is often a product of our own thoughts and biases, not an accurate reflection of reality. When you notice these thoughts, try to challenge them by considering alternative, more positive perspectives.\n2.

Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, as you would treat a close friend in the same situation. Don't be too hard on yourself for having negative thoughts or making mistakes. Instead, focus on learning and growing from these experiences.\n5. Set small, achievable goals: Setting and working towards achievable goals can help build your confidence and sense of self-worth. Start with small, manageable goals and build from there. This might include things like getting out of bed by a certain time each day, making a healthy meal, or reaching out to a friend for support.\n6. Consider therapy: If your negative thoughts and feelings persist despite your efforts to address them, it might be helpful to seek the support of a mental health professional. A therapist can offer guidance, support, and insights into why you might be feeling the way you do and can help you develop effective strategies for managing your thoughts and emotions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

It's also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important, difficult to discuss, or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.The most important thing I can tell you, though, is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive, so it's a good thing to discuss. Personally, I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time.

It\u2019s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in.\u00a0Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything! Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents, it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress and anxiety in our lives. If we didn\u2019t, none of us would be living. Anxiety & stress keep us on our toes! Often, I have to remind myself of this as well. However, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our lives.\u00a0Are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as: deep breathing exercises, meditation or yoga? Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety.\u00a0Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school, shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in. Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know, that sounds silly. But, it\u2019s true. You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold. Imagine being in the Doctor\u2019s office and taking deep breaths. This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and/or stressed. Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards.\u00a0Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be \u201cin the moment\u201d and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place, closing your eyes and thinking of your \u201chappy place.\u201d Some people use meditation music as well. If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it!\u00a0Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. I would not suggest you learning this on your own, if you have never attempted yoga before. Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and/or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students.\u00a0Lastly, in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing a letter to them, if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are open on working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue.\u00a0I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best!",

I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations\u00a0as\u00a0only being straight,\u00a0gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need.\u00a0You may never feel the need to label\u00a0how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC \u00a0",

        "text": "Hi there,\u00a0Thank you for your question. It's absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way.\u00a0First, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her.\u00a0Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share.\u00a0And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult.\u00a0Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist.",

It's crucial to remember that the dog is not the cause of the problem but rather the behavior. Your boyfriend may not be aware of the extent of the destruction caused by his pet when he's not around.\n\nHere are some suggestions for you:\n\n1. Have a calm and open conversation with your boyfriend about the situation. Tell him how the dog's behavior affects you and your living situation. Emphasize that you're bringing it up as a concern, not an accusation.\n2. If possible, enroll the dog in a behavioral training program to address the destructive behavior and house training issues. Provide your boyfriend with resources and information about these programs.\n3. Implement routine walks and potty breaks to establish a regular schedule for the dog. This routine can help reduce accidents in the house.\n4. Crate train your boyfriend's dog, which can help prevent them from destroying items when they're unsupervised in the house.\n5. If your boyfriend can't or won't resolve the issue, you might need to consider other options, such as rehoming the dog with someone who can provide them with a more suitable living environment or finding a local farm or ranch that would benefit from having a large dog.\n\nRemember that it's essential to communicate openly and effectively about your concerns with your boyfriend.

        "text": " Sure, I'd be glad to help clarify this from a therapist's perspective. In psychology, we use theory and research to help us understand the complex nature of personality. One widely used framework for understanding personality is called the Five-Factor Model. This model includes five broad dimensions, or traits, that are believed to underlie much of what we see as personality variation:\n\n1. Openness to Experience: This trait includes characteristics such as imagination, insight, and a preference for novelty and variety.\n2. Conscientiousness: This trait includes characteristics such as being organized, reliable, and goal-oriented.\n3. Extraversion: This trait includes characteristics such as being sociable, outgoing, and energized by the outside world.\n4. Agreeableness: This trait includes characteristics such as being friendly, compassionate, and empathetic.\n5. Neuroticism: This trait includes characteristics such as emotional instability, anxiety, and moodiness.\n\nWhen working with a client, a therapist will observe their behavior, interactions, thoughts, and feelings, as well as take into account information from interviews, self-report questionnaires, and other sources, to help assess their personality. The therapist may consider the presence and intensity of characteristics related to each of the five personality traits to help understand the client's unique personality profile.\n\nPlease note, however, that personality is complex and multifaceted. No single assessment method provides a complete understanding of a person. And personality is not a fixed trait; it can change and develop over time. Consulting a mental health professional for a thorough assessment and diagnosis is always recommended.",

Instead, I would recommend considering a more empathetic and supportive approach.\n\nFirst, it's essential to rule out any medical conditions that may be contributing to the enuresis, such as a urinary tract infection or constipation. A visit to a healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician, may be helpful in this regard.\n\nIf a medical cause is ruled out, it may be beneficial to use techniques geared towards behavior modification, such as bladder training or the implementation of a rewards system for going long periods without an accident.

Giving wine as a gift, especially one that comes from your country, can be an appropriate and appreciated gesture. However, you should consider a few things to ensure that your gift is not only appropriate but also received with pleasure.\n\nFirst, make sure that your counselor consumes alcohol and that it's in line with his personal and professional preferences. If he doesn't drink, it may be impolite and insensitive to give him a bottle of wine, even if it's from a revered winemaking region in your country.\n\nSecond, consider the cultural and religious contexts of both your country and the United States. Most Western countries, including the United States, have no restrictions on the gifting of alcohol between adults. However, some religious or cultural beliefs in your country may view the giving or receiving of alcohol as taboo. In such cases, you may want to consider alternative gifts, such as local delicacies or handicrafts that represent the essence of your homeland.\n\nLastly, be mindful of any university or institutional policies against accepting gifts from students to prevent any potential conflicts of interest or ethical dilemmas. Generally, a small token of appreciation as a gift should not violate any regulations. To be completely sure, you may want to ask your counselor, the university, or your student organization about any rules or guidelines on accepting gifts from students before you make a purchase.\n\nOverall, a thoughtful and culturally-relevant gift that aligns with your counselor's personal preferences and meets the aforementioned considerations can be a wonderful way to show your appreciation. Ultimately, it's the gesture and thoughtfulness behind the gift that matters most.",

Often when I talk to my clients about feelings of worthlessness we start with a little bit of self-exploration. We start with noticing. Start to notice when these feelings come up for you. Is there a particular time\nof day, a specific person who brings it out, a phrase you hear? Just\nstart to notice. Usually it's tied to something but it may take a while to figure out what that something/someone is. Try to be patient.Next we start to explore. When did these feelings start? Where do you think they come from? Is there something - a statement - perhaps that repeats in your head over and over again? If so, whose voice is it? These are difficult questions, and just a few of them, so take your time answering them. (We usually do it over a few sessions.) It might even be helpful to write them down somewhere. If you have a journal that would be a great place as research has shown that our brain works differently when we put pen to paper versus typing on a computer. Now comes the good news. Our brains are able to rewire themselves. This allows us to change habits we don't want as well as statements we say to ourselves that are no longer serving us. The next step is to select an ally. Someone who is or has been in your corner, someone who is always rooting for you. If you don't have someone like that, that's ok - a lot of us don't - you can just make someone up. Close your eyes and try to describe that person in great detail from the way they look to the way they act to the way they sound. Now, pick a phrase you would like that person to say to you whenever you start to think that you're worthless. Something that will help you feel better about yourself - a characteristic, a skill, a great joke you tell, a physical attribute. This also takes time and may involve you asking for help from someone who knows you.Once you have all of that together - the noticing, answers from where these feelings and statement(s) come from, your ally, your new statement, you can try to put it altogether. When the feelings come up, notice what is bringing them up and then call upon your ally to try to change the statement in your head from the self-defeating one to the more positive, uplifting one. I hope this was helpful. Again, I do this with my clients over quite a few weeks, if not months, and I am there with them the whole time. It is quite an involved process and can bring up a lot of very difficult feeling/memories. If at any point you find it too hard to go at alone, please seek help. If you take anything away from this reply, know that there is help out there and that it is possible to change the way you feel.",

Even if you have spectacular communication while in a long-distance relationship, it is difficult to maintain intimacy because you are lacking in the physical contact aspect of intimacy. Here, we are not talking about sex, but about the emotional connection that happens along with physical contact. It is also hard to have shared experiences when the two of you are in separate places. These are the challenges that you face, but there are some ways to improve your odds.\u00a0The first thing to remember here is that dating is all about finding a person that you want to eventually dedicate your time, resources, and self to. If either of you finds that the relationship is one that you are not necessarily committed to, it is better to find out and have the opportunity to date others before a commitment is made. The second thing to remember is that open communication is a good sign in a relationship. That being said, I do not believe that sharing details about your \"crushes\" is the best thing for a relationship. Instead, I would recommend working on improving the relationship as best you can. It is a wonderful thing when we can feel that we have given our best efforts on something, especially something as important as the act of loving.\u00a0Here are a couple things that you can do to improve even a long-distance relationship. Start by downloading the Gottman Card Decks App here https://www.gottman.com/couples/apps/. While on the phone or video chat, try asking each other some of these questions so that you can build a deeper knowledge of one another. Some may seem silly, but they help you know the other person more intimately. It is also helpful to make sure that you are having regular communication with each other. Some situations make it very difficult to communicate, but if at all possible, daily communication via phone or video chat would be best. Even if it is just for 30 minutes a day, really dedicate your time and attention to each other during those calls. Next, it can be helpful to know each other's love languages so you can show each other how much you really care. Take the assessment for the 5 Love Languages and talk about the results together. You can find the assessment here: http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/Attraction to other people is completely normal and involves biological processes. Intimacy, on the other hand, creates real connection and dedication to each other. Learn about each other, spend time together, and you will create intimacy.",

Service dogs and emotional support animals can be valuable resources for people managing anxiety and depression, as they can provide companionship, comfort, and distraction. Before obtaining a service dog, I would recommend exploring other options, such as seeking out a mental health professional who specializes in treating anxiety and depression, and trying out various therapies and techniques to see what works best for your fianc\u00e9e. This might include CBT, mindfulness practices, exposure therapy, and other evidence-based treatments.\n\nIt's also important to consider other supports and accommodations that might help your fianc\u00e9e manage her symptoms in public places, such as asking for accommodations when shopping or using the restroom, carrying a portable water bottle and nutrition bars to help her stay hydrated and nourished, or using noise-cancelling headphones to help her manage sensory sensitivity.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. I'd be happy to provide more suggestions or resources if you have any specific questions or concerns.",

The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like \"everyone cheats\", or \" you're not enough for him\". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting \"as if\" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!",

        "text": "Hello. The end of the counselor/client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement. Counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons. Among them are the client's inability to make forward progress in therapy; the clinician's inability to help the client (for a variety of reasons); a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided; or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere. In this last case, a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client's inability to pay. That is traditionally seen as an unethical practice. Other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client, which in itself should be paramount.When the client and therapist decide that services are done, it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur, and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client (and vicariously to the clinician as well, those this is perhaps not as important). This transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey...rather than some abrupt departure from it. (An abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). Sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed, in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. In this case, the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy, to a place of healing, growth and situational resolution.I have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will), that I learned years ago during graduate school: \"Not every therapist is good for every client, and not every client is good for every therapist.\" It is perhaps one of the most important guiding views I hold in working with clients. The therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life, and the therapist's desire to truly see the client heal and grow. When there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring, the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. Or, if already formed, may at some point be unable to move forward. In these instances, referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. Usually, this can be seen pretty quickly by either party, though sometimes it is not always clear.Ultimately, the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor, or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. If both are observant in this process, they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. Eventually, therapy will end, but hopefully based on the client's successful journey to the place where they wanted to go, and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter.",

His reactions may not mean that he doesn't trust you, but rather that he gets scared that he's going to be hurt again.\u00a0You're a bit vague about the past. You don't say whether you cheated or not. If you did, then you might try taking an approach where you a) take responsibility for your past actions, b) show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that, c) do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority, and d) reassure him when he says he's scared or feeling insecure. I'm suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that you're so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear. This is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injury.Part of the issue might be that when he brings it up, he's coming across as angry, accusing or suspicious, rather than scared and insecure. This often happens. A therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger, and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger (which is also natural, but less helpful in those moments), and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him.\u00a0As much as you want to forget about it, he might need to talk about it sometimes, and that's normal. His needs are important. Also important, however, is your need for respect. If he approaches it in a disrespectful way, that's a separate problem. If it's brought up as a weapon, used to shut you down, or used to control or punish, those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts.

Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced. This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. As you mentioned, sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while, but they can also come back. When they do, it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication, and/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious, and some say it calms them down. It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. These are ways to try to avoid, escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. That is a very normal thing to do. Nobody likes these feelings, and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a long-term solution. In fact, they usually make things worse for many different reasons. Depression and anxiety can\u00a0 be treated, but it is likely something you will need some help with. I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful, but I still recommend counseling. The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms, while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC",

And for lots of reasons...most of them having something to do with beginning to take one another for granted and no longer doing the little things that nourish the relationship and light our partners up. \u00a0Seems like you've encountered this in your own relationship...where he appears to be neglecting your need for emotional connection with him.Doesn't have to be this way though. And from my own personal clinical experience, I can tell you that when even ONE partner is willing to make some small but powerful changes, they can often ripple outward to the other partner and bring about miraculous outcomes!\u00a0So my encouragement to you is this - if you're still in love with him...even a little bit...and you're down to try something new, there's hope! \u00a0As hard as it may be, I would ask you to try and focus on YOUR own side of the street when approaching him. Use an open and curious approach with him.\u00a0Ask him what he thinks he needs in a marriage.\u00a0What is it about you he fell in love with?\u00a0What helps him feel more fulfilled as a man and as a husband?\u00a0What little things that you have done over the years does he appreciate?\u00a0Like Sherry said, if you can get him talking, there'll be plenty to work with. We only need a spark to kindle a fire. If he can give you a list, you'll have a blueprint for getting him to reconnect with you and it opens the door for you to offer him little suggestions as well.By the time a couple reaches the point where you're at, there's usually very little fun going on. We've stopped enjoying one another's company. Try and think creatively about some shared experiences he might be willing to do. A picnic? Happy hour? Concerts, museums, cooking class, new sexual behaviors...the list is as infinite as you want it to be!\u00a0Some of my favorite suggestions for couples looking to understand how they got here and how to build their way out are:\"The Secret to Desire in a Long-Term Relationship\" (Ted Talk) by Esther Perel\"Getting Together & Staying Together: Solving the Mystery of Marriage\" by William & Carleen Glasser\"Divorce Busting - A Step By Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again\" by Michelle Weiner-Davis\"The Relationship Cure: a 5 step Guide to Strengthening your Marriage, Family, and Friendships\" by John Gottman & Joan DeClaire\"The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work\" by John Gottman & Nan Silver\"The Five Love Languages\" by Gary ChapmanAnd of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't suggest that if you're open to the idea, maybe some individual and/ or couples counseling could be helpful too.My very warmest regards to you,Tamara Powell, LMHC",

This assessment is required by most insurances and allows the Counselor to give a diagnosis, which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the Counselor. If you are paying out of pocket, this diagnosis is not really required for payment, but many Counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us. The better we understand what it is that bothers you, what you would like to get out of the counseling, and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues, the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals. How the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the Counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling, and that information is too much for this little post.",

However, I can suggest some approaches that may help you.\n\n1. Identify negative cognitive patterns: Be aware of thoughts that contribute to your feelings of worthlessness and challenge them. Remember, it's okay to have negative thoughts, but it's important to examine their validity and whether they are helpful or harmful.\n\n2. Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Be aware of how you would respond to a friend in a similar situation and apply the same treatment to yourself. This means being gentle, non-judgmental, and empathetic towards yourself.\n\n3. Set small, achievable goals: Setting small, achievable goals and accomplishing them can help you gain a sense of control and accomplishment, which can contribute to improved self-esteem and feelings of worth.\n\n4. Seek support: Connect with friends, family, or other support systems. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone else can help alleviate some of the burden, and the support and encouragement you receive can be beneficial to your overall wellbeing.\n\n5. Professional help: Consider seeking help from a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or counselor, who can provide you with evidence-based treatments and help you develop strategies to overcome feelings of worthlessness.\n\nRemember that recovery and healing take time and effort. Be patient with yourself and focus on making progress, rather than being caught up in the destination. It's important to remember that setbacks and mistakes do not define you as a person, and with perseverance and dedication, you can move towards improving your feelings of worth.",

From the way that you wrote this, it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically, but still have cravings.One thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or OB/GYN about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings. Sometimes that can very helpful.As far as the more emotional or mental piece, these things come to mind:Sometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy. There are sometimes toys, like those available at Office Playground, that may help to keep you physically occupied.There can also be changes or additions to your routine because I imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time. Maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette, you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead. The list is endless, but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise (with the permission of your doctor) just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well, completing a puzzle, learning a new activity that requires using your hands (painting or knitting, perhaps).Another piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes, perhaps irritability. Depending on what it is that you may be feeling, \u00a0learning other strategies to use can be helpful as well.This can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change. I would recommend that if things do not become easier for you, consider talking with a therapist.

I cannot provide one-size-fits-all advice as it largely depends on your personal circumstances, but I can suggest a few general points to consider.\n\nFirstly, establish healthy communication with your ex-wife, focusing on what is best for the child. It's important to respect her role in their life even if things weren't rosy between you two. Regular, consistent contact and visits are usually considered in the best interest of the child.\n\nSecondly, creating a stable routine for yourself and your child can help you both move forward. Transitions can be difficult for children, so establishing consistent visitation schedules can help them feel more secure.\n\nThirdly, it's essential to give yourself time to heal and focus on your personal growth. Moving on from a challenging relationship doesn't mean ignoring your emotions or pretending everything is okay \u2013 it simply means acknowledging your feelings and taking steps to better yourself.\n\nFourthly, be conscious of ensuring that you are not using your child to fill emotional needs that aren't related to your role as a parent. This could create further complication for the child.\n\nLastly, you may consider speaking with a therapist to further navigate your emotions and find healthy ways to move forward in your life post-divorce.

In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say \u201cI am sad\u201d or \u201cthat really hurt my feelings\u201d and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a \u201csimple\u201d thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern.\u00a0It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset.

        "text": " I understand how difficult it can be to trust your boyfriend after he revealed that he cheated on you during your relationship. This is a normal reaction given the circumstances. Trust is a crucial aspect of any relationship, and its absence can lead to feelings of insecurity, jealousy, and even resentment. However, it's important to note that rebuilding trust takes time, effort, and commitment from both parties. Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Communication: Open and honest communication is essential for rebuilding trust. This means discussing your feelings of mistrust and your concerns with your boyfriend. It's also important for him to acknowledge his past mistake and reassure you of his commitment to being faithful in the future.\n\n2. Consistency: Consistency is key when it comes to demonstrating trustworthiness. Your boyfriend can show you that he is committed to being faithful through consistent actions that highlight his dedication to the relationship. This could include being transparent about his activities, being reliable in his commitments, and actively working to build trust.\n\n3. Patience: Rebuilding trust takes time, so be patient with yourself and your boyfriend. Trust isn't something that can be regained overnight, and it's important to remember that setbacks are normal. Stay focused on the progress that you've made and the efforts that your boyfriend is making to rebuild trust.\n\n4. Seek outside help: If you're struggling to move past your relationship difficulties, consider seeking outside help from a trusted therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide you with tools and resources to help you work through your emotions and develop healthy coping strategies.\n\n5. Take things one step at a time: Focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time. Remember that trust is a process, and it's important to build it incrementally. Each day, take stock of the small victories that you and your boyfriend have made towards rebuilding trust, and use these successes to fuel your continued growth.\n\nOverall, rebuilding trust in a relationship after an infidelity can be a challenging but rewarding process. By focusing on communication, consistency, patience, seeking outside help if needed, and taking things one step at a time, you and your boyfriend can work towards rebuilding a strong foundation of trust and commitment in your relationship.",

For example, \"I feel unheard when you're speaking, and it makes me sad.\"\n\n2. Set aside undisturbed time: Allow yourselves some uninterrupted time for conversation, turning off electronic devices and other distractions.\n\n3. Validate his emotions: When your husband speaks, show that you appreciate his thoughts and feelings. Use phrases like \"That sounds really difficult,\" or \"I understand why you would feel that way.\"\n\n4. Be specific: Use clear and specific language, focusing on facts rather than generalizations. Provide examples to help better illustrate your thoughts and feelings.\n\n5. Reflective listening: Show empathy and make an effort to understand your husband's perspective. Paraphrase and summarize what he says to make sure you have a good understanding of his point of view.\n\n6. Discuss the importance of active listening: Share with your husband the impact it has on your relationship when you both actively listen to each other.\n\n7. Nonverbal communication: Make eye contact, nod occasionally, and use appropriate facial expressions. This will help your husband feel engaged and understood.\n\n8.

Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection.\u00a0Without knowing more about the \"complicated\" nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? \u00a0Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on \"what if\" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.\u00a0However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype. It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life.

Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens.\u00a0Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now\", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say \"let's get you dressed\", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try \"as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack\". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it.\u00a0Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!",

        "text": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn't usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don't have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn't necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive.\u00a0 When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.\u00a0That\u00a0you\u00a0have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn't\u00a0usually\u00a0help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone's guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor.

Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help you calm down when you feel your anger building up.\n2. Engage in physical activity: Exercise is a great way to release built-up energy and reduce stress. Try going for a walk, run, or bike ride whenever you feel your anger escalating.\n3.

These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It's based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca",

        "text": "Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are \"negative\" so you are not alone.\u00a0I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe.\u00a0When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a \"war\" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them.\u00a0So the question I imagine you have is \"how do I get out of the tornado?\" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding \"I am noticing I'm having the thought that....\" to the front of them. For example, \"I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.\"\u00a0 \u00a0The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you.\u00a0Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense.\u00a0Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!",

It's important to remember that sexual interests and expressions can take many forms and are not always indicative of one's core identity. Moreover, the absence of a history of sexual abuse doesn't automatically exclude other possibilities for the origin of this fascination. Many individuals have unusual or unconventional sexual interests, and labels such as \"fetish\" are often used to describe these variations.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial to reflect on the potential emotional and social consequences of indulging in this activity, especially if it's impacting your daily life or causing significant distress. You might consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional to help navigate these feelings in a safe and productive way. Alternatively, you could explore online communities or support groups specifically designed for individuals with similar interests to connect with others and share experiences and resources. Remember that there's no need to feel ashamed for having unusual sexual interests; however, it's essential to ensure they're not causing harm to yourself or others.\n\nIt's worth noting that wearing women's clothing as part of cross-dressing or gender exploration is an entirely different matter from fetishes and should be approached differently. If your fascination revolves around the act itself rather than the clothing, it may be worth exploring whether this behavior is adversely affecting your life in any way and, if so, how to manage those impacts.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that personal growth and self-understanding are ongoing processes, and it's normal to encounter complex emotions and feelings at different stages of life. The most crucial thing is to learn to accept and understand yourself as best you can, with the support and guidance of trusted friends, loved ones, or healthcare professionals.",

It sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. I would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you haven't already. While depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy. With that being said - if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end, then I can't see what choice you have but to \"respect his decision\" as you mentioned. This doesn't mean that you have to feel okay with the decision - as I'm sure you wouldn't - but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make. If he is wanting to leave - this could make things a lot tougher for you. I would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family. You do not need to face depression alone - nor should you have to. We all need support at tough times like these.\u00a0",

That is a really hard thing for someone to go through.There is really no set time for grief to be over, but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief. I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job, but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day, someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help. For one thing, bills have to be paid.There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order. You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are the stages.\u00a0At first, people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.Then comes bargaining, in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever.\u00a0Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.Finally, acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days that are tough, such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one. But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable, and that life goes on.A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings, don\u2019t try to not feel them. Embrace the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does.

It's important to remember that every person and every relationship is unique, and what works best for one person may not work for another. Here are some suggestions that might help guide you in making a decision:\n\nFirst, it's essential to consider the potential impact of sharing your crossdressing on your relationships. It's essential to reflect on how much importance you place on this aspect of your identity and how you believe your partners might respond. Some people may be open-minded and accepting, while others might have negative reactions. You should also consider the level of trust and communication in the relationship. Has the topic come up before? Have you had open and honest discussions about sensitive topics previously?\n\nAnother consideration is your own feelings about the situation. How important is crossdressing to your overall well-being and happiness? If it's a significant part of your identity, you may feel compelled to maintain it, regardless of the reaction you might receive.\n\nOne approach you could consider is having an open and honest conversation with your potential partners about your crossdressing. Expressing your thoughts, feelings, and concerns in a clear and calm manner can help to ensure that both parties have an accurate understanding of each other's needs and wants. It's essential to listen carefully to their responses and work together to determine whether this is a deal breaker or not.\n\nKeep in mind that the decision is ultimately yours to make, and there's no right or wrong answer. It might be helpful to seek the support of a trusted therapist, support group, or trusted friend as you navigate through this process. Remember, the goal is to find a balance between your needs, identity, and the expectations of potential partners that allows for a healthy, mutually respectful, and satisfying relationship.",

In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STD\u2019s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don\u2019t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don\u2019t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don\u2019t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don\u2019t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though.\u00a0If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don\u2019t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don\u2019t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren\u2019t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don\u2019t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be. In time, the right person for you will enter your life.",

Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action.\u00a0Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as \"my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies.\" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. \u00a0Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful.\u00a0If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional.

In fact, that type of thinking may be stopping you from seeking counseling, so it may be hindering you from getting the help you need. In fact, all of what you described points to the importance of you seeking help in order to cope with the many challenges in your life.\u00a0If you seek counseling, it will be important for you to understand that you may need to remain in counseling for a sustained period of time in order to work through each of these issues. All of these issues won't be able to be solved right away or in a brief period of time. Counseling will take commitment and hard work, but it is possible for you to recover and heal from all of the issues you described.Many clients come into counseling with numerous issues rather than just one particular thing. Most of the time, the issues relate to and exacerbate each other. We call these \"comorbid\" conditions, which means that two or more mental health problems exist at one time. A lot of the times, when you start to work on one issue, the other issues get better as a result.I encourage you to find a professional therapist that can help you learn how to cope with all of the mental health difficulties that you described.

Transitions can be challenging, and it sounds like you are experiencing a lot of change. \u00a0This would be difficult for many people, and it seems that you have an added layer of challenge. \u00a0I recommend\u00a0visiting a therapist to determine the root cause of your anxiety and working to unravel those causes piece by piece. I know seeing a therapist can be challenging when traveling, and online counseling could be a good solution. In the meantime, here are a few of my favorite anxiety stopping strategies. \u00a01. Grounding Exercises: When you feel your anxiety increasing, take a deep breath and begin things in your room (or where ever you are) that have things in common. For example, name all of the blue things that you can see. \u00a0You can also do non-visual grounding\u00a0exercises like\u00a0naming all of the hte\u00a0sports teams you can think of or all of the state capitals. \u00a0This will get your mind off of your anxiety and connect you to space. \u00a02. The pretzel: This is a seated pose that will stop any anxiety attack in its tracks. \u00a0Start in a seated position and cross your dominate leg over your nondominant leg. Then, stretch your arms out in front of you with the back of your hands facing one another. \u00a0Cross your arms in front of each other so that your palms are touching. \u00a0Flip your arms into your body. \u00a0You will end with your elbows by your side and your hands crossed under your chin. \u00a0Close your eyes and take long breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. \u00a0This calming pose will help you get through even the toughest of panic episodes. 3. Bilateral stimulation and visualization: Start in a seated position with your hands placed on your knees. Tap each knee in an alternating pattern. Close your eyes and begin visualizing a peaceful setting. The combination of bilateral stimulation and visualization will help calm your body and mind. \u00a0I could go on and on, but these techniques should get you started. \u00a0These techniques should help you manage anxiety in a pinch. \u00a0Best of luck!",

Did you make a connection through social media or email first? Maybe a dating website? I'm just wondering if this is the case. These modern ways of meeting people are awesome because we can be exposed to a wide variety of people who we never would meet in the grocery store or a friend's party. There are complications, though, and one of the drawbacks is you can feel very connected to someone and care about them a great deal before you ever meet them in person. Then, when you finally meet them and there isn't that spark of magnetic physical attraction, you're in a bit of a difficult spot because you've already established that you're drawn to each other in other ways; you're already connected. It can be very awkward then to say \"Now that I meet you, it doesn't feel the way it should for me\". In the future, I suggest meeting up in person early on, to answer that crucial question \"Are we physically attracted to each other?\". Clearly, this is not only important for you, but it is for most of us.My guess is that you feel you owe this man your affection and commitment even though you're not really all that into him (lusting after other men is a sign of that), because you like absolutely everything else about him. But honesty is crucial here, both with yourself and this man. Just because you don't find yourself attracted to him doesn't mean that you're a bad person, or that he's not attractive. Someone else might drool over him and I think he deserves someone who does just that. You can have both love and lust. For most people, only one of them isn't enough.",

If the Xanax is not working well for you, I wonder if something else may work better. What is your reasoning there? Also, sometimes there are medications that you can take in addition to Xanax.In addition to talking with your medical provider about changing the medication, try to track your levels of anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day so you can get a pattern of what is happening. Also consider writing down what is happening before you have anxiety attacks. This may help your medical provider know what medication may be helpful to you or what changes could be made.As far as how to discuss this with your medical provider, I would suggest mentioning the symptom changes you are having (anxiety attacks that are not helped with 0.5mg of Xanax) and ask what they would suggest that might help. If your medical provider suggests taking you off of the Xanax, I would recommend talking about the reasons why you would prefer to stay on the Xanax and what your concerns are about coming off of it. You could also ask whether anything could be combined with Xanax.There are also many other anxiety medications. I have seen lots of people that take more than one medication to lessen anxiety that they are having.I would also consider talking with a therapist (unless the person who is prescribing a medication is also doing therapy with you).

You may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues, or if you have ever heard him talk about it. That may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you. For example, if he has been watching the news lately, transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot. Has he had an opinion? This won't tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender, but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people. To tell you the truth, the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you. There is no right or wrong way, best or worst. If you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him? That's perfect. Want to have a friend with you for support? Equally perfect. Whatever thing you need to do. And, of course, there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so. Unfortunately, the response from your dad can't be predicted. Some parents are totally cool.... others not so much. This is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea. If things get heated, you have someone in your corner. There are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy, and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him. You can also Google some stories about how others came out.I refer many people to the www.letsqueerthingsup.com blog. It is a popular blog written by a trans man that I know. He writes on many topics related to trans issues. Hope some of these suggestions help. Be well... be you.. and good luck!Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ",

It's not uncommon for couples to experience conflicts, but when they happen regularly and intensely, they can be distressing. There are several reasons why arguments might occur more often in a new marriage. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Miscommunication: Learning to communicate effectively is an ongoing process, especially when two people are used to speaking in different ways. Misunderstandings and miscommunications can lead to arguments.\n2. Unrealistic expectations: Newlyweds can have unrealistic expectations about their spouse and marriage. When these expectations aren't met, arguments can ensue.\n3. Financial issues: Money-related problems are a common source of conflict in marriages. With two people bringing their financial habits and values into the mix, there can be disagreements and misunderstandings.\n4. Adjusting to a new lifestyle: Marriage can involve significant changes in lifestyle, such as living together, blending families, or adapting to new household routines. These changes can cause stress and lead to arguments.\n5. Unresolved issues from the past: Old wounds, emotional baggage, or unresolved issues from each person's past can reappear in the marriage and cause tension and arguments.\n\nAs your psychologist, I would suggest several strategies to help improve the situation:\n\n1. Practice effective communication: Be open and honest about your feelings. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements. Practice active listening and try to understand your partner's perspective.\n2. Set aside time for open and respectful discussions: Schedule a regular time to discuss and resolve any conflicts. These discussions should be held in a calm, respectful manner, with a goal of finding a mutually beneficial solution.\n3. Seek professional help: Consider seeking help from a marriage counselor or therapist. They can provide you with tools and techniques to effectively navigate issues and strengthen your relationship.\n4. Prioritize self-care: Make sure that each of you is taking care of your own emotional and physical needs. This can help reduce the stress and tension in the marriage, making it easier to address conflicts when they arise.\n5.

You don't say whether you cheated or not. If you did, then you might try taking an approach where you a) take responsibility for your past actions, b) show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that, c) do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority, and d) reassure him when he says he's scared or feeling insecure. I'm suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that you're so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear. This is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injury.Part of the issue might be that when he brings it up, he's coming across as angry, accusing or suspicious, rather than scared and insecure. This often happens. A therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger, and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger (which is also natural, but less helpful in those moments), and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him.\u00a0As much as you want to forget about it, he might need to talk about it sometimes, and that's normal.

Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book \"Opening Up\" by Tristan Taormino.\u00a0I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C",

        "text": " I understand that this new situation with your boyfriend's work and traveling is causing you distress and anxiety, especially as it relates to the changes in communication and frequency of interaction between you both. As you've mentioned, these feelings could potentially be indicative of separation anxiety.\n\nFirst, it's essential to acknowledge your emotions and give yourself permission to feel them. It's natural to experience sadness, especially when facing significant life changes.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you cope with this situation:\n\n1. Open communication: Try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you feel. Share with him that you're finding it challenging to adjust to his absence and the reduced level of communication, and ask if there's a way you both can find balance in your relationship despite his travels.\n2. Establish a routine: Maintaining a routine can help provide sense and stability in your daily life. Set aside time each day for activities such as exercise, hobbies, or self-care to help distract you from your anxiety.\n3. Create a support network: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for additional emotional support.\n4. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Engage in mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, to help manage any feelings of anxiety or sadness.\n5. Seek professional help: If your feelings of anxiety and sadness are impacting your daily life or ability to function effectively, consider seeking out the services of a mental health professional who can help you develop strategies and coping skills to better manage your emotions.\n\nIt's important to remember that communication and understanding are key elements in any relationship. It's crucial to approach the conversation from a place of love and concern for the both of you, rather than anger or frustration. If your boyfriend is willing to be supportive and listen, it may lead to a stronger bond between the two of you and ultimately help you both navigate this situation.",

It sounds like you're concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an \"addict\" or \"alcoholic.\" You might have a \"problem\" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.\u00a0I don't have information to know if \"addiction\" or \"dependence\" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I'm writing here is very general and doesn't address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. \u00a0One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you're avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support.\u00a0Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that's your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you don't drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger.\u00a0I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness.",

I would recommend considering seeking therapy to work through your past experiences and current feelings of depression and low self-worth. Healing from trauma takes time, but with the right support, you can learn to rebuild your sense of self and form healthy relationships. Additionally, taking time for self-care activities and setting personal goals can help you regain a sense of identity beyond being a mother.",

        "text": "Hello. Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. That said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way. Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. The counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.Once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet. That first session is often very low key. There might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details. All of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.In the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous. Here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor. It's true. We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. What makes it even more challenging, is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we're standing on a three legged stool). This is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. Counselors and clients are both human, and we both make mistakes. Coming from that place of understanding, might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together.\u00a0Part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors, is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. We honestly do not, plain and simple. Counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life's road than you); they hold completion of various forms of training; and have advanced education. Yet we are in the end, imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. This makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. Very often, we can find ourselves reflected in our clients' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. So as you begin to seek out a therapist, try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. Someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. That counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength, and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy.",

        "text": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Self-diagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. Taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal, however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. Here are a few reasons for this: 1. Making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides\u00a0matching up\u00a0the symptoms of a disorder. To come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned, a counselor\u00a0would consult the\u00a0DSM, but they\u00a0may also\u00a0use some type of screening tool, assessment or scale. Many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. 2. Our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. We really can't be objective. Something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. In addition, once you know your diagnosis, treating it usually requires help from a professional. 3. Sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes self-diagnoses impossible, in and of itself. For example, someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. That would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. There a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. There are other reasons, but these are\u00a0three important ones. Now, does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? Maybe not. You may be correct. But,\u00a0it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician. If a disorder is then found, you can begin to talk about treatment. Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

Of course he does, because there are many things that are beyond his control (his ex's behaviours, for one). Accept the powerlessness. Lean into it. It's okay, because there are many things he does have power over, and that's where he can focus.\u00a0He has the power to give his children a happy dad. That's HUGE. That's why he left, I'd guess. I bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels. That's his ex's voice...that's what she wants him to feel...to give into that is letting her win. Ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right. He has not intentionally harmed his children.

I would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you. Also, most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done, but after that, the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping. If something is or is not working, communicate this with your therapist. This is a big deal. Most therapists I know actually welcome this feedback.There is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance (the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy) is very important. Also, sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis. If that is something with which you are struggling, I would encourage you to talk about that as well.In addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with, you may consider trying something like yoga or meditation.

It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that.\u00a0So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with.

It's important to remember that finding the right therapeutic fit and building a strong therapeutic alliance can take time. However, if you're feeling that your needs aren't being met in your current therapy, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Share your concerns with your therapist: It's possible that your therapist is unaware of your dissatisfaction and may be able to adjust their approach to better meet your needs. Be specific about what you need from therapy in terms of feedback, support, and exploration of your issues.\n2. Consider seeking a second opinion: It may be helpful to explore other therapeutic options to see if a different therapist's approach would be a better fit for you. This can give you a sense of what is available in terms of therapists and can also help you build a stronger therapeutic alliance from the beginning.\n3. Consider seeking out additional resources: In addition to therapy, there are other resources that can support you in your recovery. This can include support groups, books, online communities, or self-help resources.\n4. Reach out to your healthcare provider: If you have ongoing medical concerns related to your eating disorder, your healthcare provider may be able to offer additional support or resources.\n\nRemember that recovery is a process, and it's important to prioritize your own needs and advocate for yourself in your therapy.

Cross dressing is something many people enjoy, and there is\nno harm in it whatsoever.\u00a0My question to you would be: What is making you feel torn\nabout it? There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with\npeople who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the\nmajority. (And sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or\neven in the majority, but because people carry shame about being different when\nit comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alone!)Being a sexual or gender minority or someone who\nparticipates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a\nunique and personal way often means suffering from something called\n\"internalized oppression\". We grow up being exposed to certain\nassumptions and beliefs about what is \"acceptable\" behavior and even\nface consequences sometimes if we don't \"fit in\" the way others tell\nus to. Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong, we still internalize\nthem and feel guilty about who we are. There is nothing wrong with us, but\nfeeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment,\nor like something is \"wrong\" with us.But there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, so be proud\nof who you are and what you enjoy. You can continue to simply enjoy it\nprivately, or maybe you'd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe\neven join a community with similar interests.

It may be incredibly helpful to find a counselor you can both go talk with. Having a third party who is neutral and cares about your process and hers can be such a relief when you need to discuss things you feel scared about. Even just a few sessions can make a huge difference.\u00a0If this doesn't feel possible for you right now.....ask your fiancee for time to set aside for a meaningful heart-to-heart talk. Say you'd like to set it up on the calendar, and make sure you have a babysitter for your son. Set aside at least 4 hours. Let her know that you'd like to hear her honest truth about what's going on, and share with her your truth as well.

While counselors work closely with medical providers, and sometimes have discussions about medications with people, we rarely make recommendations about how much or what type\u00a0of medication\u00a0a person should be taking. This is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice. The only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, etc. Having said that, I certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with. If you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks, you should consider it. Medications can be helpful for anxiety, and medications like Xanax may help for immediate relief, but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety long-term. Therapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with. Exposure therapy has\u00a0good outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks. If you are interested in speaking with your provider about the Xanax, I think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine. The provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication. Please remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time. Medications like Xanax really are highly addictive. The more you take, the more you may feel you need. The more often you may feel you need to use it. Depending on the frequency and amount of use, some people suffer serious withdrawal symptoms when they do not take the medication. It is a good idea to talk to medical\u00a0provider about all of those things so that you can partner on right course of action to manage this anxiety. I certainly hope that you get some relief.... I know anxiety is awful.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ",

That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their child.What's confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him/her (depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn). When dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child. If you cannot come to an agreement, a counselor can help mediate a conversation.

So then someone comes and asks the first boy why he's so miserable, because he has so much. He says that he's missing the one toy that he really wants. Then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says \"With all this sh-t, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere!\"Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. That's a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say \"I always see the worst end of things\". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change.\u00a0The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. I know how to fix friendships), 2. Specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women.\u00a0The feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different.

I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone \u00a0(sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. For example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself \"I'm anxious right now and I'm okay\" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own (which is very common), consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.Also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable.",

They can provide you with evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), or trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy, which are effective in treating PTSD and depression.\n\nMedication, such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, can also provide relief and help you manage your symptoms. It's essential to find a healthcare professional who can offer an integrative approach to your treatment, addressing both your PTSD and depression.\n\nPracticing self-care, engagement in pleasurable activities, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, practicing mindfulness meditation, and seeking support from loved ones and support groups can also be effective ways to improve your overall well-being.\n\nRemember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as caring for your physical health, and you are not alone in this journey. Help is available, and I encourage you to seek it out.",

If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are\u00a0incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we\u00a0 are feeling anxious.

Imposter syndrome is a common experience, particularly in academic settings where high achievement and excellence are expected. Here are a few suggestions that may help you manage these feelings:\n\n1. Reframe your mindset: Instead of focusing on the fear of being found out as a fraud, reframe your thoughts to acknowledge your achievements and the effort you have put into them.\n2. Challenge your inner critic: When the feeling of being an imposter arises, challenge those negative thoughts by providing evidence that contradicts them.\n3. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to experience emotions like fear or doubt without judgment.\n4. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or colleagues about your feelings and gain a perspective from outside of your own internal dialogue.\n5. Focus on the present moment: Instead of dwelling on past mistakes or potential future outcomes, focus on the present moment and the work you need to do right now.\n\nRemember, imposter syndrome is a common experience, and many successful individuals have felt the same way at some point in their careers. It takes time and effort to silence that inner critic, but with practice, it is possible to overcome these feelings and continue to thrive in your academic pursuits.",

One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.",

The fact that you're still suffering a year later suggests that there might be some unresolved feelings or unmet needs that you're grappling with.\n\nIt might be helpful for you to consider a few things. First, it's essential to understand that healing from a breakup takes time. This process involves grieving the loss of the relationship, allowing yourself to feel the painful emotions, and gradually working to rebuild your sense of self-worth and confidence. This can be a lengthy process, and it's essential to be patient with yourself during this time.\n\nSecondly, it may be valuable to explore the reasons why the long-distance relationship didn't work out. Often, when we're apart from our partners, we miss the connections that we had when we were together. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge that being in a long-distance relationship presents unique challenges, and that even if both partners are committed to making it work, there are often logistical and emotional obstacles that can be challenging to overcome.\n\nAnother consideration is whether there are any unmet emotional or psychological needs that you're seeking to fulfill through the memories of your past relationship. This can be a challenging topic to explore on your own, and it may be helpful to work with a therapist to gain some insight into the underlying emotions and motivations that are driving your continuing attachment to your ex.\n\nLastly, it's important to consider taking steps to move forward in your life. This might involve engaging in activities that bring you joy, connecting with friends, pursuing new hobbies or interests, or even considering meeting new people and possibly starting a new relationship. While it's natural to feel hesitant or uncertain about this, it's crucial to remember that healing from a breakup involves taking steps to rebuild your sense of self and your life.\n\nIn summary, healing from a breakup takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself during this process.

If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like \"what, how, who, where, when.\" Questions that start with \"why,\" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood.\u00a0Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.",

It's possible that your current partner may not be as physically appealing to you as others, but he might possess other qualities that make him the better match for you in terms of emotional and intellectual compatibility.\n\nWhen considering marriage, it's essential to weigh the importance of physical attraction versus other aspects, such as mutual respect, trust, communication, and shared values. If you find that, despite your physical attractions, you have a strong foundation built on these fundamentals, it might be worth considering the long-term potential of your relationship and the benefits it offers beyond physical attraction.\n\nThat being said, it's always important to communicate openly with your partner about your feelings and concerns to determine whether you both can work towards improving your relationship. If you find that the issues at hand are not resolvable, then it might be time to consider whether staying in the relationship is truly best for your emotional well-being.\n\nIn summary, while physical attraction can play a role in the success of a relationship, it's not the only factor.

For some people, honestly, it's a game... to see how much power they have over you or it's their need to control you. If you don't want contact from this person, it's really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (\"Don't contact me again\"), and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you don't want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me\". That's great self-talk.But let's get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it's because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those \"good old days\". The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what they're eventually showing you is who they are and what they're capable of. People do change and grow, but it won't happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.\u00a0Another reason we can't let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It's as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn't demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.\u00a0It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone's poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance.",

        "text": "Hello,This question describes a very typical setup of what is called the \u00a0Binge, Repent, Repeat cycle. This means that typically after you binge, you experience emotions as you described \"shame and disappointment\" and then because of these emotions you \"repent\" (i.e. vow to never binge again, promise to \"do better,\" go to the gym, etc.) and then ultimately end up bingeing again.\u00a0There are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to NORMALIZE eating. Meaning you need to attempt to eat normally, eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day, with snacks in between. IF you binge, then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors, and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating, then this actually leads to a binge again. Thus, reverting you back to the cycle. If you binge, it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge. Although it may feel counterproductive, getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle.\u00a0It can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred, it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past. Focus on what you can do differently next time. What emotions or situations led up to the binge? What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge, or the way that you handled the situation?\u00a0Lastly, if you're struggling with \"normalizing\" eating, it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally, mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating.

There is some key information here (I don't know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he's stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I'll give you my thoughts.I see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. \"What can I get away with?\" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out.\u00a0Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I'm not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea.\u00a0It's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth.\u00a0You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You're making honesty fun. Kids love games.\u00a0Basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative.\u00a0If this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist.",

Cooperation in this way, in the moment, with a live person who is supposed to have authority and knowledge in these matters, can be profoundly healing.If the therapist can't take feedback or doesn't want to--or does nothing to act on it--maybe we could say the client has the wrong therapist.",

It's important to prioritize your own mental and emotional well-being. Here are some strategies that may help you manage your gender dysphoria:\n1. Seek professional help: Consider working with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who specializes in gender identity issues. They can provide you with ways to cope, offer support, and help you develop a plan for coming out to others.\n2. Connect with the trans community: Reach out to local or online transgender community groups. They can provide you with a sense of belonging, support, and understanding that may be hard to find elsewhere.\n3. Educate yourself: Learn as much as you can about gender identity and the transgender community. This knowledge can help empower you and give you a better understanding of your own experiences.\n4. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as exercise, hobbies, or creative pursuits. Remember that taking care of yourself is an important step in managing your gender dysphoria.\n5. Create a support network: Identify trusted friends, family members, or mentors with whom you feel comfortable discussing your gender identity. Building a network of supportive individuals can make coming out and dealing with gender dysphoria easier. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and reaching out for help when you need it is a sign of strength. I wish you all the best on your journey.",

As a psychologist, I want to emphasize that your feelings are valid, but let me clarify that guilt or shame can serve various functions in our lives. While it's true that you have the autonomy to make decisions regarding your body, emotions can be influenced by various factors, including societal norms, personal values, and relationships.\n\nFeeling guilty could indicate that you have violated a personal value or standard, or that you've hurt someone's feelings or trust. Conversely, it's possible that the guilt may serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining healthy relationships and boundaries, encouraging self-reflection, and fostering emotional growth.\n\nIt's essential to consider the implications of your actions both in the short-term and the long-term. Reflect on feelings of guilt, and ask yourself whether these emotions are serving as a reminder to make amends, learn from the situation, or maintain stronger relationships and commitments in the future.\n\nIt may also be helpful to communicate openly with your friend and your spouse regarding your feelings and thoughts about the encounter. Honesty, transparency, and empathetic communication can lead to a stronger understanding of your emotions and relationships and facilitate healing.\n\nUltimately, the decision to feel guilty or not lies within your personal value system and emotional response. It's essential to consider the potential benefits of feeling guilty and the potential consequences of suppressing these emotions. The goal is to reach a place of self-awareness, emotional healing, and growth, both as an individual and in your relationships.",

Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important.

You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider\u00a0suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline.

If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment, I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress.

However, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask\nyourself to help you find your answer:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDo you feel like you are violating your own\nvalues or morals? This is important, because we all have different values and\nmorals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. If you value monogamous\nrelationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel\nlike you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not\nhappy when they do that. However, if monogamy is not something you value, then\nperhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still\nright for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships, and that\nis alright. Finally,\u00a0if you value your husband\u2019s feelings and know that the\naffairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your\nown values. That can only be determined by you. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on how you describe your relationship, it\nsounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is.\u00a0 From the outside, it looks like the affairs\nare a way to \u201cget even\u201d with your husband or to feel better after an argument. This\nis something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a\nrelationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about\nhow our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the\nquestion to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband,\nis this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex,\nargument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. \n\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What are your goals for this relationship? If we\nstart to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things on\nautopilot. Get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. None\nof which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and\ndreams you once had for this relationship?\n\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHave you considered seeking marital counseling? Not\nhaving affairs won\u2019t actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading\nyou to have them. If there is something broken, it sometimes requires some help\nto get it fixed. \n\u00a0Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to\nsome kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship.

Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with\u00a0life's obstacles, including anger management. There are several strategies that you can try to\u00a0help control your anger, but the\u00a0ones that\u00a0I would recomend first are the following:1.\u00a0Try a different way of communicating with your parents. Since\u00a0arguing with\u00a0them is a great source of anger for you, learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit.\u00a0Choose a time to talk with them\u00a0about \"heated issues\" when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened. Use \"I phrases\" by telling them how the arguments effect you, as opposed to placing blame on them.\u00a0Validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view.2. When you feel yourself becoming angry, take a break. Simply excuse yourself from the situation, find a quiet place to be by yourself, and do some deep breathing. Close your eyes, slowly count to four as you inhale, and exhale\u00a0even slower, counting to 6. Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.3. Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. Often times when we get upset, we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid, then let them go and replace them with realistic, logical thoughts.4. Finally, find a friend or someone to talk to and/or keep a journal. Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you. Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry.I wish you all the best!",

I would also suggest doing some self-exploration and see a\r\ntherapist for individual sessions in order to gain a clearer insight as to what\r\nthe cause is. There are also several actions you can take on your own to help\r\ncontrol your anger and communicate more effectively.\u00a0Here is what I would recommend\r\nyou try:\nTake time outs: When you feel yourself becoming upset, excuse yourself and\r\ntake a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of\r\naction\u00a0or redirect your thoughts all together. Often when we\u00a0become\r\nangry, it is difficult to see the issue clearly, as our emotions\u00a0get in\r\nthe way.\u00a0\nDo deep breathing exercises: Close your eyes. Breathe in slowly to the\r\ncount of 4. Breathe out even slower to the count of 6. Practice this for about\r\n5 minutes, 3 times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this\r\ntime. Once it becomes routine for you, it will be easier to apply during\r\nsituations in which you are angry or upset.\nChange negative thought patterns: Try and recall or be aware of your\r\nthoughts, particularly when you are feeling angry. What are these thoughts\r\ntelling you? Are they valid or logical? Is there factual evidence to support\r\nthe negative thoughts? Often the answer is \"no.\" Learn to stop the\r\nnegative thoughts and replace them with logical and\u00a0more positive\r\nones.\u00a0\nCommunicate effectively: As a speaker, you want to use \"I\"\r\nstatements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming him/her\r\nby using \"you\" statements. For example, you might say something such\r\nas, \"I feel sad when you don't come home at a decent hour and I don't get\r\nto spend time with you\" versus \"You always stay out late and don't\r\neven care about me.\" The speaker should also avoid using black and white\r\nlanguage such as always, never, etc. As the listener, you want to validate what\r\nyou hear so that the other person knows that you are listening. You will also want\r\nto be responsive and offer fair solutions.\nI wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes\r\nfrom.\n",

You have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend!\u00a0It sounds like he's maybe a bit immature and moody, and these things affect you, for sure. I get it.\u00a0It's\u00a0got me curious, and if I was working with you, I'd want to know a lot more about how long you've been together and\u00a0what's actually working well between you two. I would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description. What tells you he's 'sneaky'? Does he lie? How do you know he lies to you? Also, are you wanting to make things better with him, do you just want an ear to vent to, are you looking for validation, or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation? \u00a0It helps me if I know what you want.Whenever I meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend, I encourage them first to look at the language they're using. Some of your words tell me that you think you know what he's thinking (that he wants to fight so he can leave, that he thinks he's perfect). It's always tricky when we assume what someone's thinking, and in an argument or dialogue, these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument. I'd encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you, rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours (because you really can't know what he's thinking unless he tells you). As a general rule, the \"When you do X, I feel Y\" sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.So, it's fair to say \"when you lie to me, I can't trust you\", or \"when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like I'm not important to you\", or \"your mood swings are difficult for me\", or \"I don't seem to get apologies from you\". Try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff. A relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationship.That said, I have to ask...if you haven't been with Mr. Not So Great for very long, is it maybe time to rethink the relationship? Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that you're leaving out, you don't seem happy. A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship, if that is what's happening.\u00a0There's a lot to sort out here...how to communicate about your needs, how to know when to call it quits if something doesn't feel good...

It may feel overwhelming to consider addressing all of these issues in counseling, but the good news is that counseling can be a safe and supportive space to explore each of these experiences and develop the skills and insights needed to improve your mental health and well-being.\n\nThe number of issues you have doesn't necessarily dictate whether counseling can be effective. Rather, the focus should be on prioritizing which areas are causing the most distress or interfering with your daily functioning, and addressing those first. It's also important to remember that addressing one issue can have positive impacts on other areas as well.\n\nI'd be happy to help guide you in the counseling process and to work collaboratively with you to address the specific challenges you're facing. It might also be beneficial to consider seeking out specialists in certain areas, such as trauma therapy for your history of sexual abuse, to ensure that you're getting the most effective and specialized care for each area of concern.\n\nCounseling is a personal journey, and it's important to go at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Together, we can determine a plan that prioritizes your concerns, but also takes into consideration your personal resources and goals. Let me know what you think about this approach.",

        "text": "Thanks for writing. There are many different house of things that may be helpful here. I can give you some general ideas, but if some of these things don't get you to where you would like to go, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples:Remember that you can only guarantee change in yourself. You can ask him to make changes, but you can't control whether he does or not. You can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions in the relationship.If you're going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen, first ask whether this is a good time.Try to talk to him without blaming, finger-pointing, or asking him to change (this can be difficult, but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussions).Be mindful of your packaging. By that, I mean that you may have a very important message that you're trying to get across. If you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what you're actually saying, that is helpful. If you are talking in ways that are angry, or as I sometimes say, wrapped in spikes, that can be difficult to hear and receive. Rather than hearing what you're actually trying to get across, he may just hear the fact that you are angry.If your husband is able to listen to you and/or restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right, let him know what that feels like to you and how important it is.If you're asking questions, try to avoid \"why\" question and use \"what makes, how, when, where, who\" instead. Questions starting with \"why\" can not only be difficult to answer, but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right away.Also, keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement. This may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband \u2013 just because he is hearing what you're saying doesn't mean that he's agreeing with you.Lastly, but importantly, some people really don't know how to listen effectively. There are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives. Sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerability-producing. It may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that he's really struggling.",

Here are some factors that might help you determine if a therapist is right for you:\n\n1. Chemistry: A good therapist-client relationship involves mutual trust and respect. You need to feel comfortable with your therapist and be able to share intimate thoughts and feelings.\n2. Therapeutic approach: Different therapies work best for different people. It's essential to understand what type of therapy your therapist uses and whether it resonates with you.\n3. Effectiveness: Pay attention to whether your therapist is helping you make progress towards your goals.\n\nRegarding your second question, keep in mind that therapists are professionals trained to meet the diverse needs of their clients. They do not need to be \"trained\" like a pet or an object. Instead, it's essential to communicate openly and respectfully about your expectations, concerns, and preferences. Here are some suggestions for approaching this topic:\n- Express your feelings: Explain how you feel about the therapy and your therapist, as well as what you want to gain from your sessions.\n- Ask questions: Don't hesitate to ask your therapist any questions you may have about their approach or techniques.\n- Offer suggestions: If there's something you believe might help enhance your treatment, share it with your therapist.\n\nThe most important thing is to remember that therapy is a collaborative process. Be open to trying new things, but also feel free to voice your concerns if you don't feel that things are working for you.\n\nIf, after a few sessions, you don't feel that your therapist is a good match for you, consider seeking out another therapist. A therapist who's not a good fit for you won't be able to help you make the progress you're seeking.\n\nI hope this information has been helpful, and please feel free to ask any other questions you may have.",

Communication breakdowns in relationships are common, but repeated patterns of avoidance or blame can be damaging if left unaddressed. Here are some suggestions that may help you and your partner improve communication and resolve conflicts more effectively:\n\n1. Reflect on your own contribution to the argument: Instead of focusing solely on your partner's part in the conflict, take a moment to reflect on your own role and contribution to the dispute. This can help you take responsibility for your part in the argument and approach it with a more constructive mindset.\n2. Practice active listening: When your partner speaks to you during an argument, make sure to listen carefully to what they are saying without interrupting, judging, or becoming defensive. Try mirroring back what they said to ensure that you have a clear and accurate understanding of their perspective.\n3. Avoid name-calling and personal attacks: Instead of attacking your partner's character or personality during an argument, focus on the behavior or action that you find problematic. Speak about your feelings and your experience of the situation, rather than accusing or blaming your partner.\n4. Take a time-out: If the argument becomes too heated, it may be helpful to take a break and revisit the discussion when you're both feeling calmer and more rational. This can help reduce the emotional intensity of the moment and allow you to approach the issue with a more clear-headed and constructive mindset.\n5. Seek professional help: If you and your partner continue to struggle with effective communication and conflict resolution, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with the tools and techniques you need to strengthen your relationship and improve your communication skills.\n6. Stay focused on your shared goals: Remember that despite your disagreements, both you and your partner have a shared goal of raising your kids in a happy and healthy family environment. Try to keep this goal in mind during disagreements and approach them with a sense of shared responsibility for resolving the conflict in a productive and positive way.",

Depending on your son\u2019s age, he might need some input or advice.\u00a0 Provide the opportunity to interact with other children, without pushing it.\u00a0 Take him to the park to play with a friend or to children\u2019s activities in your neighborhood. \u00a0Later ask him, what did he thought\u00a0of the activity, and if he enjoyed playing there.\u00a0 Children also follow their parent\u2019s model, so you can encourage social interaction by greeting other and asking your son to do the same, ask him to receive the guests who come to the house with you and sit to enjoy the conversation.\u00a0If you notice any shakiness, becoming tearful, anxious or aggressive when approaching social encounters, you may want to talk to the school counselor or children\u2019s therapist to evaluate those symptoms and rule out any behavioral problems or social anxiety.Mi hijo juega solo en el receso.\u00bfDeber\u00eda preocuparme al respecto?\u00a0 \u00bfDeber\u00eda hacer algo al respecto?Cada mama es experta en la conducta de sus hijos. \u00a0Primero que nada te sugiero que revises con tu hijo y le preguntes si \u00e9l se siente contento jugando solo, o si se queja porque nadie quiere jugar con \u00e9l.\u00a0\u00a0 Observa si \u00e9l juega solo en la escuela, pero es sociable en otros ambientes como con la familia\u00a0 o los vecinos.\u00a0Jugar solo puede ser saludable para los ni\u00f1os, les ayudo a ser independientes, desarrollan sentido de seguridad, y les permite explorar su ambiente y utilizar su imaginaci\u00f3n, entre otros beneficios.Por otro lado, tambi\u00e9n es importante desarrollar destrezas sociales y perfeccionarlas con la pr\u00e1ctica.\u00a0\u00a0 Los ni\u00f1os van por etapas de exploraci\u00f3n y prueba hasta que desarrollan un nivel de confianza en sus destrezas sociales.\u00a0 Dependiendo de la edad de tu hijo, puede que el necesite algunos consejos.\u00a0 Prov\u00e9ele la oportunidad de interactuar con otros ni\u00f1os, sin obligarlo. Ya sea yendo al parque a jugar con vecinos, o a actividades comunitarias infantiles con alg\u00fan amigo.\u00a0 Luego preg\u00fantale como le pareci\u00f3 la actividad y si le gusto compartir all\u00ed. \u00a0Tambi\u00e9n recuerda que los ni\u00f1os siguen el modelo de sus padres, as\u00ed que puedes motivarlo invit\u00e1ndolo a que salude a otros despu\u00e9s de ti, o invit\u00e1ndolo a recibir a la visita que llega a la casa y que los acompa\u00f1e durante la conversaci\u00f3n.Si observas que tu hijo est\u00e1 nervioso, lloroso, o agresivo cuando se acerca alguna actividad social, consulta con el consejero escolar o un consejero infantil para evaluar sus s\u00edntomas y descarta cualquier problema de conducta o ansiedad.",

However, if these negative thoughts are causing you significant distress or interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to consider some strategies.\n\nFirst, validating your experience is important. Remember that thoughts are just mental events, and while they can seem very real and powerful, they do not necessarily reflect reality or the truth. It's essential to recognize that having negative thoughts does not mean that they reflect who you truly are as a person.\n\nYou can also practice cognitive restructuring techniques to help challenge unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more balanced and constructive ones. This can involve identifying the thought pattern, testing the evidence for and against the thought, looking for alternative perspectives, and finally, replacing the thought with a more helpful and positive statement.\n\nLastly, practicing mindfulness meditation or other relaxation techniques can help you learn to observe thoughts as mental events without getting carried away by them. There are many resources available to help learn these techniques, including classes, books, and guided meditation apps.\n\nAs always, it's essential to remember that while self-help resources can be helpful, if your thoughts or emotional distress are severe, it's always a good idea to consult with a mental health professional for personalized guidance. If you feel that you may be at risk for harming yourself or others, please consider reaching out to a crisis hotline in your area immediately.",

Focus solely on the speaker - Give them your full attention. Put away any distractions, like your phone, and avoid multitasking. Make eye contact if possible and don't interrupt them.\n\n2. Refrain from interrupting - Allow them to finish their thoughts. Patiently wait for their pause before responding.\n\n3.

Show empathy - Reassure them that you understand their feelings, validating their emotions, even if you don't necessarily agree with their viewpoint.\n\n5. Practice active listening - Engage in the conversation rather than being passive. This involves giving verbal responses, making acknowledging noises, and maintaining a positive attitude.\n\nAs for \"getting yourself together,\" consider self-reflection to manage any emotions that may be arising. Understand the triggers that cause these emotions. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. Seek therapy if necessary to address deeper issues and learn coping strategies.

Your reaction is understandable; it's his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open. But that's not who your dad is. Your dad is your dad, and waiting for him to change won't really help. Nothing you do can change your dad, but...there are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him.\u00a0While your response of avoiding him is understandable, I wonder what effect it has on your dad. It's possible that he's feeling frustrated, rejected and punished by your withdrawal. You may think he knows that you're feeling hurt, but he probably doesn't. So this is the squirrel chasing its tail: your dad is rude, so your habit is to be silent, then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated. His frustration comes out as more rudeness, which makes you want to withdraw more, and the cycle starts all over again. You can't change his part of the cycle but you can change yours.Are you willing to take a risk? Can you be honest about how you're feeling? What's the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad \"You know why I avoid you? I stay silent because when I talk to you say rude things. So if you want me to talk, I need to know you can listen.\" I imagine it would come out differently because you're a few generations younger than me, but put that into your own words.I don't know the level of your dad's 'rudeness'.

But if you don't worry your dad will hurt you, maybe give honesty a try.My point is that, as rude as your dad may be, checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude. It's powerful...your silence. Your dad can't read your mind, and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with him.And, if you're both open to it, seeing a therapist together can be really helpful. :)",

        "text": "Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.\u00a0One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define \"infidelity\". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, \"I feel you distancing from me.\" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.\u00a0The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a \"sweetheart.\" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean \"you're so sweet and kind\", \"my dear\", or in a flirtatious manner to mean \"sweetie.\" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. \u00a0If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, \"I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much.\" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying \"sweetheart\" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, \"I'm sorry.\" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says \"I'm sorry\", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.\u00a0For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.",

Unfortunately, in some relationships children get used as a bargaining piece and I am hearing that may be happening in your relationship.\u00a0You can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child. It is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child. It is important for your children to have some consistency in his or her time with you.

This will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled times.I would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your child's life. How you can both be there to help raise her. If this is not a conversation that you can have on your own you might seek out help from the court.

I understand how frustrating and isolating it can be, particularly when you don't receive the support you need from your family. Let me reassure you, it's important to know that all feelings are valid, even if they may not make sense to others.\n\nThe good news is that there are effective treatments for anxiety and panic disorders. Graduated Exposure Therapy, also known as the hierarchical exposure method, is one of the most widely used and empirically supported approaches. This therapy involves exposing yourself gradually and systematically to the situations that trigger your anxiety, under the guidance of a mental health professional, to help you learn to cope with your fears and build confidence.\n\nIt's essential that you surround yourself with people who believe in your ability to overcome your challenges and can offer you emotional support. If family members are unable to be that source of support, consider seeking out friends, support groups, or mental health professionals to help you through this difficult time.\n\nAs for your concerns with feelings of meaninglessness and depression, it's worth mentioning that these emotions can be a natural response to facing significant challenges in your life. However, if your thoughts of wanting to give up on living ever worsen or you find that you're experiencing persistent feelings of hopelessness or depression, please don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional. They can help you explore resources and develop strategies to improve your overall well-being.\n\nWith dedication, patience, and the right tools, it's possible for you to reclaim your life and find joy in experiencing new adventures with the people who matter most to you. Remember that taking the first steps towards change can be hard, but the rewards are worth it in the long run.\n\nI hope that this information is helpful to you. Remember, you're not alone in this struggle. And please know that, as a psychologist, I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to let me know.",

Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can help stabilize your blood sugar levels, thereby reducing the urge to binge eat.\n\nLastly, consider enlisting the support of a healthcare professional, such as a therapist or nutritionist, to help you develop a customized plan for managing your binge eating. Remember that it's normal for progress to be slow, and setbacks are a natural part of the process. Keep in mind that every step you take towards managing your binge eating is a step towards greater self-care and overall well-being.",

Here are some suggestions on how you can cope with verbally abusive situations:\n\n1. Develop a self-care routine: Taking care of yourself is essential in managing stress and maintaining good mental health. Ensure you get enough rest, exercise regularly, eat well, and practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.\n\n2. Use \"I\" statements: When your parents start abusing you, try to respond in a firm, neutral, and non-confrontational manner. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements to express your feelings and concerns. For instance, instead of saying \"You're making me feel...\" say \"I feel...\".\n\n3. Practice active listening: In these situations, it's natural to want to defend yourself or respond to their abusive comments. However, focusing on their abusive language can make the situation worse. Instead, try to listen attentively and acknowledge their emotions to de-escalate the situation.\n\n4. Stay calm and composed: Regardless of what your parents are saying, try to remain calm and composed. Easier said than done, I know, but staying calm can help minimize the conflict and lower the emotional tension in the room.\n\n5. Prepare a list of coping statements: Have a list of positive affirmations or coping statements ready that you can repeat to yourself during these interactions. This will help you to shift your focus away from the abusive words and towards more positive thoughts.\n\n6. Seek support: Speak to a trusted friend, family member, or helpline to discuss your situation and gain perspective. Confiding in someone can help you feel less alone and may offer additional insights and resources for dealing with the abuse.\n\n7. Create your exit strategy: Although it might be challenging, it's important to establish a plan for removal from the situation. This can include leaving the room, engaging in an activity that distracts you, or reaching out to a trusted friend or support system.\n\n8. Consider counseling: Talking to a mental health professional about your situation can help you better understand the dynamics of the abuse and develop effective coping strategies.

This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. I recommend a book titled \u201cBoundaries: Where you end and I begin\u201d by Anne Katherine. Another book that might be helpful is \u201cCodependent No More\u201d by Melody Beattie.\u00a0In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship. Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own. Needing another person to define you is problematic. That\u2019s too much to expect from any individual.For a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own. That means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs. It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time. There will be times that they won\u2019t be able to meet your needs.

The fact that you've been cheated on again after having been unfaithful yourself and being forgiven, adds an extra layer of complication.\n\nFirstly, it's important to remember that healing from infidelity is often a long and challenging process. You're showing resilience and an authentic desire to work through this and move forward in your relationship. However, this may not be an easy fix and it's crucial that both parties are fully committed to the healing process.\n\nHere are some steps you can consider taking:\n\n1. Communication: Have a heartfelt conversation with your partner about how you feel, without being accusatory or judgmental. Tell her that you're open to forgiveness, but need transparency, trust, and commitment to repairing the damage.\n\n2. Seek professional help: Couples therapy may help you and your partner work through this together. A therapist can help you explore both of your emotions and provide tools and techniques to rebuild trust and strengthen your relationship.\n\n3. Patience and self-care: This process takes time, so be patient with the healing. Incorporate self-care practices, such as meditation, exercise, eating healthy foods, and engaging in hobbies to maintain your emotional and physical well-being.\n\n4. Set some boundaries: Identify what you need from her and your relationship to feel respected, safe, and confident. Set clear boundaries and ensure your partner understands and respects them.\n\n5. Consider the future: Take some time to reflect on the meaning and purpose of your relationship, and what you truly want for yourself and your family. Be honest about whether you believe this is the relationship you want to continue to invest in and move forward with.\n\nUltimately, it's your decision to make based on the unique circumstances of your situation, but I recommend taking these steps to begin addressing the issues and working towards a healthier relationship.

Resistance and ambivalence from clients: Some clients may be reluctant to engage in the therapeutic process, or may actively resist the counselor's efforts to help them.\n3. Cultural and individual differences: Counselors must be sensitive to clients' individual cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and values, and may need to adapt their approach to meet the client's unique needs.\n4. Ethical dilemmas: Counselors must navigate ethical dilemmas, such as maintaining confidentiality while also ensuring client safety, and balancing the client's needs against the counselor's own professional goals.\n5. Burnout and self-care: The emotional demands of counseling can be intensive, and counselors must prioritize their own self-care in order to avoid burnout.\n\nEach of these challenges can be addressed through effective communication, empathy, flexibility, and a strong ethical foundation.

For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. \u00a0When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. \u00a0In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. \u00a0Having \"a lot on my mind\" sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with \"emptiness.\" \u00a0In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having \"a lot on my mind\" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? \u00a0Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? \u00a0Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism?\u00a0We can feel \"alone\" even when in a crow of people or at a party. \u00a0This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. \u00a0If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, \"You are worth nothing\" or \"You don't deserve the company of others\" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time.\u00a0The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. \u00a0Looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy.\u00a0",

However, it's essential to remember that everyone's timeline is different, and there is no one right way to experience these milestones in life. Everyone's experiences with relationships and sexuality are unique. Comparing yourself to others, especially based on limited information, can be misleading and potentially harmful to your emotional wellbeing.\n\nRegarding your concerns about losing your virginity, it's important to note that this experience is not just about physical intimacy but also emotional connection and consent.

It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide.\u00a0Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\" \u00a0Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? \u00a0This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you.

This leads to two questions: 1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor, and 2) What is the right approach?1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor? The right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. He or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. Further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The in-depth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their in-the-moment experience. It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. As well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you.' 2) What is the right approach?\u00a0 As Carl Jung stated, \"When the doctor sits down with the patient he (or \r\nshe) must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person.\" The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development, attention to pre-verbal imprinting, development of awareness ability, ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience, development of a process orientation, attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met, identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest, increased ability to access and contain non-ordinary states of consciousness, attending to what is, and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development.depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. anxiety is not the problem. it is a sign that there is a problem. the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re-initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage.",

Yes, this could well be an expression of anxiety, or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations. Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of knee-jerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific (or perhaps even non-specific) circumstances. Do you think it is a self-soothing behavior? Do you feel good after you have done it? The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage, so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor, to rule out any injury. If none exists, this obviously doesn't excuse the behavior, it just says that for the moment luck is on your side.When we do any behavior of any kind, it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value. Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem, or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place. In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue, when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there, but now they are intoxicated. No closer to solving the issue. When we deal with things like anxiety or depression, we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms, but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions. So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm, but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us.Sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea. Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of self-harm, wouldn't you agree? So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings, as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity.Reach out if you need help...there will likely be a hand there waiting for you.",

        "text": "Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are \"negative\" so you are not alone.\u00a0I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe.\u00a0When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a \"war\" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them.\u00a0So the question I imagine you have is \"how do I get out of the tornado?\" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding \"I am noticing I'm having the thought that....\" to the front of them. For example, \"I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.\"\u00a0 \u00a0The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you.\u00a0Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense.\u00a0Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!",

This leads to two questions: 1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor, and 2) What is the right approach?1) What are the identifiers for the right counsellor? The right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. He or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. Further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The in-depth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their in-the-moment experience. It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. As well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you.' 2) What is the right approach?\u00a0 As Carl Jung stated, \"When the doctor sits down with the patient he (or\nshe) must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person.\" The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development, attention to pre-verbal imprinting, development of awareness ability, ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience, development of a process orientation, attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met, identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest, increased ability to access and contain non-ordinary states of consciousness, attending to what is, and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development.depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. anxiety is not the problem. it is a sign that there is a problem. the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re-initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage.",

Giving her some breathing room could help her gain clarity.\n2. Communicate effectively: When you are able to discuss the situation with her, make sure to approach the conversation calmly, openly, and empathetically.

However, this doesn't mean you should stop communicating or caring for yourself in the process. It's essential to prioritize your emotional health and well-being. If the situation persists, seeking support from a mental health professional or a trusted support system can help provide you with additional perspective and coping strategies.",

This could be due to the fact that the threesome helped you feel closer to your partner and brought some excitement into your sexual relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, you also mentioned feeling an empty or sad feeling before the experience happens. It's possible that this emotion stems from feelings of jealousy or insecurity, or from a fear of rejection or abandonment.

From what I understand, you had a brief romantic relationship with your friend in the past, and it has since turned into a platonic friendship. The fact that you spent a weekend with him upset your current boyfriend.\n\nAs a psychologist, I'd like to clarify that whether you were wrong or not is not the most important question. Instead, it's essential to reflect on the reasons behind your actions and how they impacted your relationships.\n\nIn this situation, spending time with a friend, especially one with a romantic past, is not inherently wrong. However, it's critical to be open and honest with your current partner about your intentions, the nature of your friend's relationship, and how you manage the emotional and relational boundaries.\n\nIf you believe your interactions with your friend could potentially harm or upset your current relationship, it may be helpful to engage in open and supportive communication with your boyfriend, as well as establish guidelines and boundaries to ensure that your friendships do not interfere with your current romantic commitments.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to maintain trust and transparency in romantic relationships while also respecting the importance of friendships and old connections from the past. By fostering open and honest dialogue, maintaining clear boundaries, and focusing on building a strong foundation of trust and commitment, you'll be well on your way to navigating these situations effectively.",

Sometimes when I'm working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety, I ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds. \"What are the worst thoughts that run through your head?\". Often they struggle, perhaps out of shame; maybe they don't want me to know their worst thoughts. But I can help them better if I do know, because then we have a place to work from. You are feeling hopeless and worthless, and your thoughts support these intense emotions.\u00a0I don't know you, but I strongly believe that you have someone in your life who, if they heard your thoughts, would say \"That's not true. I know where her value is.\" I believe that there are people who would see your value clearly, even if in small things. Can you imagine those voices?You mentioned God, so let's invite God into the conversation. What might God say to you? What evidence might God...who sees all..have of your worth? What hint might God give you about your purpose?\u00a0You suffer from severe anxiety, and the agoraphobia works together with fear; they're a tag team. Fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you (or something equally bad), and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth. Do you see their plan? Make her scared... keep her here alone...convince her it's hopeless. They both try to convince you that they are your only friends, except they're lying to you. They only want power over you.You forget your worth. You forget that we all have worth. No one is a waste. I believe all God's creatures have worth, and that we're here to use our gifts to improve the world, and to remind each other of our value. There are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs. Can you find them? My guess is you've been alone and isolated for a very long time and it's impossible for you to see your worth in this situation. We need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors. We see our value in their eyes.\u00a0Do you remember the first time you questioned your worth? What was happening that you blamed yourself for? Can you speak to that child and tell her (or him) that whatever's happening isn't her fault? It's that child who cannot see her own worth, probably because someone treated her as though she had none. That's only a story though; not the truth. Can you find another thread of a story? Who might tell a story of your worth?Oak Harbor, I believe that there is help closer than you think. Fear wants you to believe it's hopeless. You reached out here...can you reach out again? Start with just one person, and that will lead you to somewhere. We don't know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone? You've stopped living. You can choose any moment to start.\u00a0I wish you peace and hope. :)",

Your experience of heightened anger, particularly in response to trivial issues, is not uncommon. The fact that you recognize that your partner's behavior may be influencing yours is a critical first step.\n\nAnger is a complex emotion that can be influenced by various factors, including personal experiences, biology, and interpersonal relationships. In your case, you mentioned that this issue started after you began a relationship with your soon-to-be husband. Anger can sometimes be a learned behavior, especially when it is modeled by significant others.\n\nIt's essential to take steps to manage your anger, not only for your own wellbeing but also for the sake of your young children. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Identify Triggers: Be aware of situations, thoughts, or people that consistently trigger your anger. Once you can identify the triggers, you can begin to take steps to manage your reactions.\n\n2. Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness meditation and deep breathing exercises can help you become more aware of your emotions and reduce stress and anxiety, making it easier to respond to triggers in a healthier way.\n\n3. Set Boundaries: Communicate your emotional needs and limitations to your partner, setting clear boundaries for what you find acceptable and not acceptable behavior. Be consistent in enforcing these boundaries.\n\n4. Develop Coping Skills: Identify coping strategies that work for you, for example, engaging in physical activity, listening to music, or writing in a journal. Make sure you have a list of several strategies so that you can choose one that suits the specific situation.\n\n5. Seek Support: Connect with friends, family, or a mental health professional for additional support and resources. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when needed.\n\n6. Practice Self-Compassion: Be gentle and compassionate toward yourself. Remember that change takes time and patience. Allow yourself to make mistakes and grow from them rather than chastising yourself for every slip-up.\n\nAnger management is a process and will require committed effort. Remember, small changes can make a big difference in managing your anger. Stay consistent with your efforts, and observe the positive impact it will have on your relationships and overall wellbeing.",

I like your healthy boundaries, and I'll help you explore possible ways to respond to her.\u00a0First, she hasn't asked yet, and you don't know that she will. Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. They're not hurting you and if you ignore them, they're more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if she's offended, that doesn't mean that you're being mean; it means that she has unrealistic expectations. So, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. You might never have to face that moment. But, I understand that you want to be prepared.As her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. Is he willing to do this? But if you are comfortable, and if you're the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it won't happen. And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying \"but maybe later\". No need to apologize or hum and haw...\"We love that you want to be around Junior, and we definitely want you in his/her life. (try to leave out the \"but\" here). You're not in a healthy place, and we're not comfortable with you caring for him/her on your own.\"If she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. I'd let her know that it's not negotiable, that you understand if she's disappointed, but you're not open to discussing the issue. Really, there's nothing to discuss. Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life. I wish you the best.",

If it was meant to be a joke and it did not work, that is not entirely your fault.I wonder how you could forgive yourself for what happened?Are you able to seek what you meant to do compared to what actually happened?Do you notice that not everything that has happened here is in your control?Do you recognize that even though you would like things to be better, if your friend is not ready or willing, you are trying to do your part to make it right?Maybe everyone who is/was involved in this can talk together all at the same time to set straight what is truth and what was misunderstood.I wonder if you can think of your own positive attributes (for example: honesty, compassion, trustworthiness, friendship, good listener, caring) and look at what truly exists within you rather than just one your friend is able to see right now.This can be really difficult for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that it involves more than just you, so it's important to focus on the idea that you can ask these other people who were involved to discuss it, but that is ultimately up to them.Best wishes for looking at the positive parts of yourself and your friendships.",

It is normal for you to feel a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and despair. Adjusting to a new situation, especially after giving up a successful business and moving to a different state, can take time, particularly when dealing with emotional trauma and financial challenges. It's important to remember that everyone's healing process is different and there is no set timeline for how long it should take. Feeling overwhelmed, struggling to adapt, and feeling weak or powerless at times are all common experiences during this process.

However, it's important to remember that you are not alone.

This is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. \u00a0It may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. \u00a0It's important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. Do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?In regular, open-ended sessions, I try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. In these check-ins, I use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. \u00a0I also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. \u00a0In goal-oriented sessions, I check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and I remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal.\u00a0Often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. \u00a0This is actually a great place to go with them; why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? Often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. That said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up.\u00a0In the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you.

Once you have ruled out any physical causes, you can take some steps to manage the behavior:\n\n1) Identify the triggers: Keep a record of when and why you feel the urge to hit your head. It could be due to anxiety, stress, or other emotions.\n\n2) Find healthier coping mechanisms: Replace the head banging behavior with calming activities like deep breathing, meditation, or engaging in a creative hobby.\n\n3) Practice mindfulness: Be aware of your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations without judgment. This can help you gain better control of your actions.\n\n4) Seek support: Share your concerns with trusted friends, family, or a mental health professional. They can help you find new ways to manage your anxiety or past traumas.\n\n5) Self-compassion: Be gentle with yourself and acknowledge that changing behavior is a process that takes time and patience.\n\nIt's essential to remember that I am an AI language model and cannot provide definitive diagnoses or recommendations, but I can offer you suggestions based on general psychological knowledge.

It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself.

Generally, counselors, therapists, and other healthcare professionals are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of their clients' records, including information about relapses, unless there is a clear and present danger to the client or others.\n\nAs for halfway houses, they are not typically considered healthcare providers, so their legal and ethical obligations regarding confidentiality may be different. In some cases, they may be required to report certain information to family members, law enforcement, or other authorities, but the specifics of these requirements depend on the policies of the particular halfway house and the applicable laws.\n\nRegarding a potential legal case for failing to report, it would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in medical malpractice, wrongful death, or similar areas of law. They would be able to assess the specific circumstances of the case and provide more accurate and detailed information on any potential legal avenues.\n\nUltimately, while it's natural to want to seek answers and accountability in the aftermath of a tragic loss, it's important to remember that the legal and ethical complexities of substance abuse treatment and confidentiality can be a challenge to navigate. I suggest seeking the guidance of a qualified legal professional for more definitive answers on this issue.",

If you are driving long distances on a regular basis, you want to make sure that your body is in a comfortable position. Second, select some music or podcasts that work for you, rather than against you. Soothing music is good, as well as inspirational podcasts. Alternatively, listening to books can be a great way to spend the time, improve your mood, and find inspiration. Third, make sure that you have plenty of time for your commute. If the drive normally takes you 30 minutes, plan on 45 (or if it's 45 minutes, plan on an hour). This way you won't be rushed, can take your time, can focus on your driving, and if traffic is a bit backed up, you've got plenty of time to reach your destination.Finally, if you do find yourself being anxious in a way that impedes your driving, pull over to the side of the road, take some deep breaths, and sit with your feelings. Take a deep drink of water. Consider jotting your feelings down in a journal. If its safe, get out of the car and walk around a bit, stretching you muscles and breathing in the air.But most of all, be kind to yourself. I wish you much success in your new job.",

If your fianc\u00e9 consistently belittling or dismissive towards you, this may be a sign of emotional abuse or manipulation.

I would suggest that you try and have an open and productive conversation with her about her behavior. You can express how her words make you feel and try to understand why she's acting this way.\n\nAdditionally, consider seeking couples counseling. A trained therapist can help facilitate a healthy dialogue between you and your partner and can offer tools and techniques to help both of you communicate more effectively. Lastly, self-care is incredibly important in any relationship. Make sure you're taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally.

Seek professional help: Working with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can help you develop coping strategies and learn how to manage your symptoms more effectively.\n2. Consider medication: There are several medications that can help alleviate PTSD symptoms, especially those related to anxiety and depression. Your doctor can help determine if medication is right for you.\n3. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that help you relax and recharge, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies.\n4.

It's important to remember that you have the right to choose who you open up to and how you communicate about your depression.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to communicate your needs more effectively:\n\n1. Be clear and firm about your boundaries: When your mother initiates conversations about your depression, calmly and clearly state that you don't feel comfortable discussing it with her at that moment. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings: \"I don't feel comfortable discussing my depression with you right now.\"\n\n2. Set consequences for boundary violations: Let her know that if she continues to instigate conversations about your depression despite your request to stop, you will no longer engage in those conversations. For example, \"If we continue to argue about this, I will have to end the conversation.\"\n\n3. Repeat the process: It's likely that your mother will continue to push the subject, so you may need to repeat the same communication several times before she understands. Don't let her intimidation or arguments deter you \u2013 stay calm and firm in your boundaries.\n\n4. Explore alternative sources of support: If your mother is not supportive or is causing distress during conversations about your depression, consider finding alternative sources of emotional support, such as a trusted friend, family member, mental health professional, or support group.\n\nIf the situation continues to escalate or become dangerous, do not hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional or support organization for further guidance.

Their blog articles will reflect the kind of work they do and the approach they may take while working with you. If there's an email listed, go ahead and reach out. Ask the particular questions that are on your mind. Share a little of what you are looking for in a therapist. Are you a goal-direct, solution-focused individual who is looking for someone to listen and ask questions? Are you less self-directive and desire a therapist who can give you the consistent push to move forward? Are you interested in intertwining certain theory approaches? Maybe a cognitive-base or experiential? Art therapy or engaging in exercise while talking? Your therapist is out there. It's OK to try out a therapist for a session or two. Interview them as they interview you. It's also OK to change therapists; ask your present therapist for a referral. He or she should be willing to provide you with names of other providers and there's no shame in asking for it. You deserve to work with someone who fits your style!I imagine there's already enough things happening in your life if you are searching for a therapist. Do you really want to \"train\" your therapist? After all, you are paying them for their knowledge and expertise. It does take time to develop a relationship and developing one with your therapist is vital to your growth and satisfaction. Participating in therapy, for the most part, should be a time you anticipate and not avoid. Can you be honest with them? Are you trusting of the confidentiality they provide? Has this person clearly shared with you the limits of confidentiality if using insurance versus paying privately? Is there any part of you that \"just isn't sure\"? It's okay to assert yourself in therapy. As a therapist, I invite you to assert yourself as it's a way to develop self-confidence and resiliency. Not everyone thrives in therapy by sitting in an office or lounging on a couch. Some folks benefit by challenging themselves in various environments, or are more comfortable in their homes, online, in the community, at a retreat, etc. Give yourself a gift of spending some time finding the person that can work with you towards what you are searching. Although there's the convenience of the local non-profit agency in your area, it may not be what you need. Also, limiting yourself to the names of providers listed on your insurance may not lead to the \"right one\". There are many forms of therapy that insurances refuse to cover. When this happens, many times you can be reimbursed for your expenses by your insurance or you can use a Health Savings Card or Flexible Spending Card, there are many, many options. Therapy is about exploring yourself. Go ahead and feel free!If you feel as if you need to \"train\" your therapist, it seems that person is not the right fit for you. Engaging in treatment should be quite comfortable from the outset of treatment. Many independent practitioners or small group providers offer a free consultation to start the relationship. Perhaps that's a place for you to begin? Good luck and I wish you well!",

Eating a Balanced Diet: Proper nutrition can help ensure that your body and mind are functioning optimally.\n5. Planning Engaging Activities: Finding enjoyable activities to do during the winter months, such as reading, hobbies, or attending virtual events, can help keep your mind engaged and focused on positivity.\n6.

It's not uncommon for people to experience sadness or depression when they stop using alcohol, especially if they have a heavy drinking history. This can be due to various reasons such as withdrawal symptoms, changes in brain chemistry, or emotional reasons.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to validate her feelings and encourage her to express herself openly. Let her know that it's okay to feel sad, and that you're there for her. Be patient and supportive, and try to understand what she's going through.\n\nYou can also suggest that she seeks professional help such as a therapist or a support group to help her cope with her emotions. Encourage her to engage in self-care activities like exercising, eating healthy, practicing relaxation techniques, and staying connected with friends and family.\n\nIt's important to remember that the decision to move should be based on what's best for her mental and emotional wellbeing. If she believes that a change of environment might help her recover, then it may be worth considering. However, if she's open to staying, you can explore ways to support her at home. You could offer to help with household chores or cook healthier meals for her, for instance.

Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Practice active listening: Give your undivided attention to your partner. Look into their eyes, listen intently, and avoid interrupting or finishing their sentences. Paraphrase what they've said to show that you understand.\n\n2. Use open-ended questions: Ask questions that cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" This will encourage your partner to share more about their thoughts and feelings.\n\n3. Avoid defensiveness: Instead of getting defensive, acknowledge the validity of your partner's emotions and perspective.\n\n4. Validate their feelings: Let your partner know that their emotions and thoughts are important and understood by you.\n\n5. Reflect on your own behavior: Reflect on the role you may have played in the relationship problems.

It's important to remember that everyone's experiences with coming out are unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Your parents may not fully understand or may have limited knowledge and experience with bisexuality. Their comments about bisexuality may reflect ignorance or misunderstanding, not a negative attitude towards you. Before deciding to come out to them, you may want to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Educate yourself: Learn more about bisexuality and how to explain it to others in a simple and clear way.\n2. Gauge their openness: Consider how accepting your parents have been towards other sexual orientations and individuals who identify that way.\n3. Decide if you're ready: Consider your personal readiness to discuss your sexual orientation with your parents. Some people choose to come out when they feel secure and ready, while others prefer to wait until they feel they can deal with any potential reactions.\n4. Choose the right time and place: Find a private and quiet place and choose a time when they are in a good mood and receptive to conversation.\n5. Use clear and direct language: Clearly state that you identify as bisexual and explain what that means to you. Answer any questions they may have in a calm, patient, and respectful manner.\n6. Be prepared for their reactions: Know that their reaction may range from acceptance to surprise, confusion, or even rejection. Be prepared for any possibility and have a support system in place if needed.\n7. Offer resources for further information: Provide them with information, books, or websites about bisexuality to help them better understand your identity and experiences.\n\nRemember that coming out is a personal decision that you should make when you feel safe and ready. Regardless of their initial reaction, having an open and honest dialogue with your parents can help them gain a better understanding and acceptance of your sexual orientation, ultimately fostering a stronger bond in your relationship.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to seek out a supportive community of people who understand and accept your identity while building resilience to any potential negative reactions from others. Joining a local LGBTQ+ organization, attending support groups, or engaging in online communities can be helpful resources for you.\n\nI hope this information is helpful",

        "text": "Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, \u00a0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.\u00a0",

It's absolutely vital.\u00a0Sounds like your mom may have missed that memo.\u00a0Like many parents, she may feel your behavior and choices is a direct reflection of her. Or that her role as your mother allows her greater latitude than it should. \u00a0Or like many other people in general, that her way is the ONLY way.\u00a0Regardless, this is YOUR life. \u00a0And as far as we know, it's not a dress rehearsal.

One thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like \"I cannot talk about this now, but we can talk about it in two hours.\"My best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship, either romantic or in childhood. If he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it, it would be good to know what that is. It could even be that he's learned to handle conflict that way.Something else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not. These sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couples.As far as what you can do now, perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before, that you love him and believe that he loves you, or some other statements that are true for you.

If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term \"enabler\". A lot of the times, when people think they're \"helping\", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay.

Coping with triggers related to sexual abuse can be challenging and sometimes overwhelming, but there are several strategies that may help.\n\nFirst, it's essential to identify your triggers and become aware of the physical, emotional, and behavioral responses they elicit. Only then can you begin to develop effective coping strategies. Some people find that deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation can help manage the physical responses to triggers. Others may find that grounding techniques, such as focusing on the present moment or engaging in a sensory activity, can help refocus the mind and reduce feelings of anxiety or fear.\n\nIt's also important to have a plan in place for dealing with triggers when they arise. This could include identifying safe places or people whom you can turn to for support, engaging in a comforting self-care activity, or using a coping statement to remind yourself of your strength and resilience.\n\nFinally, seeking support from a therapist or other mental health professional may be helpful. A therapist can provide you with additional strategies for coping with triggers and can help you work through the emotional and psychological challenges of sexual abuse survivorship.

We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes.\u00a0I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you \"not being yourself\", and then how you felt when your grandma died.\u00a0When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works.\u00a0When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us.\u00a0So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support.\u00a0There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say \"Get off my back!\". \"You're not helping me by telling me lies.\" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self?

I like that you're honest enough with yourself to say \"I'm struggling with this\". To accept that there is a question is a brave place to be. And...it doesn't necessarily mean you're gay.Unfortunately, we live in a culture that wants to put people in slots...male or female, straight or gay...we tend to not like those grey areas so much as a culture. The truth is that, if we grew up in a society where there wasn't this categorization...if we felt free to explore and grow sexually, we might be surprised at who we are attracted to. You don't have to put yourself in a slot. Our sexual preferences are more fluid than we think, and it can change over time.We also live in a culture where there is prejudice against homosexuality or \"differentness\" in general. The wish to not be gay can be powerful. Many people who are gay spend years believing they were heteroxual...fighting against, repressing \u00a0or ignoring their gay thoughts. This is needless pain. If you are gay, there is no shame in that and you can still have a glorious life filled with love and passion.Having said all that...just because you have thoughts about men or get turned on by gay porm doesn't mean you're gay. Many heterosexual people have thoughts and fantasies about the same sex; it's arousing because it's naughty...we're curious about the forbidden, or we're just curious. Becoming aroused by gay porn is normal for many heterosexual men.\u00a0Sexual orientation isn't just about sex either. A different gauge of who you are sexually can be found in your emotions towards men or women. Are you drawn into emotional connections with men more than women? Who do you feel the urge to explore and be close to?Exploring your sexuality through being open to different experiences can help too. How does it feel to kiss a man, to touch a man, as compared with a woman...sometimes this feels like such a big and forbidden step that it's a barrier to discovering ourselves. We don't want to open that door.\u00a0I wish you well as you do exactly what you are supposed to be doing...exploring and discovering yourself. It's an exciting journey and you might want to find a trusted person to talk more about this with.\u00a0",

It's unfortunate that your attempts to seek help have been met with challenges due to your age. Here are some suggestions that might be helpful:\n\n1. Find a supportive adult: Look for an adult you trust and feel comfortable with. This could be a teacher, a mentor, or even a trusted neighbor. Share your experiences and concerns with them. They can offer advice, support, and may be able to help you in ways you haven't considered yet.\n\n2. Document your experiences: Keep a journal or records of your experiences. Write down the details, including dates, times, and any relevant information. Consider saving any physical evidence, such as texts, emails, or drawings. Having concrete evidence can be helpful when discussing your experiences with others.\n\n3. Report the incidents to authorities: Keep trying to report the incidents to the police or other appropriate authorities. You may consider discussing the challenges you've faced with your school counselor or principal, who can help advocate for you.\n\n4. Seek professional help: There are therapists and counselors who work specifically with children and adolescents. Consider looking for a therapist in your area who specializes in trauma or abuse. Ask for their assistance in finding an adult to attend sessions with. Even if you can't attend sessions alone, your presence with a trusted adult can be beneficial.\n\n5. Reach out to support groups: Connecting with others who have had similar experiences may help you feel less alone and give you a better understanding of your situation. There are various support groups dedicated to victims of abuse, available both in-person and online.\n\n6. Don't give up: Continue seeking help and advocating for yourself.

You could also ask whether he is able to hear what you want, wish for, or desire between the two of you.Remember, just because you hear or follow what he is saying does not imply that you agree with him, although that concept in itself could be a subject of discussion because not everyone is aware of it.I hope that you are able to hold onto who you are and what you want throughout this.",

Therapy provides a safe space for individuals to express their emotions freely, and crying is just one way people can do that. It often signifies significant emotional growth and can even be a relief for some. Don't worry if it happens to you, you're not alone.",

Also, brain activity increases with physical exertion. Just walk around for a minute and get your brain working and that'll help you reach the task at hand. Taking breaks it totally okay. Try to have something to do in between that you enjoy.\u00a0",

This can be caused by a variety of things, such as stress, anxiety, certain medications, or even medical conditions like sleep apnea. Have you discussed this issue with your primary care physician yet? They may be able to identify any underlying causes and suggest potential treatments. In the meantime, you might want to try some relaxation techniques before bedtime to help reduce stress and promote better sleep. I'd be happy to discuss these techniques with you further if you'd like.",

        "text": "You didn't say what or how many medications you've tried. Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven't heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting \"Ohm\" to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.I hope this helps and best of luck to you.",

        "text": " I understand that these thoughts are distressing for you. They may be a sign of an internal struggle, possibly related to feelings of low self-worth or self-criticism. These thoughts are not uncommon, particularly in individuals dealing with anxiety or depression.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that having thoughts you don't want doesn't make you weak or define your worth. I encourage you to practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and understand that everyone experiences negative thoughts and self-doubt at times.\n\nTo help manage these thoughts:\n1. Practice mindfulness meditation: Focus on your breath, the present moment, and acknowledging thoughts without holding onto them.\n2. Challenge negative thoughts: Whenever a negative thought comes up, ask yourself if it's based on facts. Refocus on the positive aspects of yourself and your life.\n3. Engage in activities that make you feel good: Do things that bring you joy and help boost your self-esteem.\n4. Consider seeking support: Talking with a mental health professional can provide valuable insight and tools for managing these thoughts.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop mental resilience, but with consistent effort and self-compassion, you can learn to manage negative thoughts and improve your overall wellbeing.",
