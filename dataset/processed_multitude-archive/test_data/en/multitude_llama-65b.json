        "text": ", Warns of ConsequencesPakistan claims US scuttled Afghan peace efforts, warns of consequencesISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Sunday that the US scuttled efforts to bring about peace in Afghanistan.Speaking to Geo News, he said the Trump administration “scuttled” recent talks between the Afghan Taliban and the United States, the latest attempt to end the 17-year conflict.“The US administration has scuttled the talks which were at a nascent stage,” Qureshi said.He said peace in Afghanistan was in Pakistan’s interest. “Pakistan has been facilitating the talks between the US and the Taliban but we will no longer be able to do that now,” he said.Qureshi said the Afghan Taliban are not being treated with “respect” by the US. “They [the Taliban] are fighting for the last 18 years. The US wants them to stop fighting, but how can that be achieved if they’re not treated with respect,” he added.He said Pakistan would continue to help the US in its Afghan peace process but Washington “must change its line of action in Afghanistan.”He said Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan were good and both countries need to work together towards a shared objective.On a question, the foreign minister said Afghanistan is a land-locked country and its future economic prosperity depends on Pakistan. “It would be in Afghanistan’s interest to have good relations with Pakistan,” he said.When asked about the fate of the proposed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS), Qureshi said Pakistan would continue its bilateral relations with the US.On Saturday, Qureshi said the two-day talks between representatives of the US and the Taliban were paused after the Afghan government pulled out of the meetings.He said the Afghan government pulled out of the second round of US-Taliban talks in Doha because of an “agenda disagreement”.",

It will move further in a north/northeast direction and weaken gradually,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement, as it lowered its cyclone warning.There were no reports of casualties in the state, the agency said, but three people died in the path of the storm elsewhere.A 12-year-old girl died in the eastern state of Odisha after a tree collapsed on a hut in which she was sheltering, NDTV reported.Another man was killed in Andhra Pradesh when a tree fell on him and a fisherman was killed after being crushed by the mast of his boat after refusing to take shelter on land, according to IANS news service.Some 2.14 million people were evacuated from coastal districts in Odisha as the state suffered a blackout, with supply lines snapped by three major ‘extremely severe cyclonic’ storms expected over the next three days.Airports at Kolkata and Bhubaneswar were shut until Saturday as the storm, dubbed “extremely severe” by the IMD, pounded the region.The Bangladeshi government ordered the evacuation of more than one million people along the coast. Hundreds of thousands of them took refuge in shelters as the storm approached the low-lying nation, officials told AFP.“",

At the ceremony, 15-year-old Rosa Fukun will be one of the flag carriers for the first Olympic team from East Timor.While many young East Timorese are looking to independence with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, Rosa Fukun has no doubts.\"I am very proud and happy to be selected,\" she said, \"This will be a great moment.

She was born in East Timor, fled with her family during the Indonesian occupation and now goes to school in Portugal, where her mother lives.East Timor's team will include three other women and four men, including two marathoners. They will all be under the age of 21, and they are in the last stages of training and fund-raising.Olimpio Lopez is the East Timorese chef de mission. \"These are the first athletes we can call athletes and not just sports people. They are athletes now because they're in good shape. I think it's very important that people from outside get the message that the future belongs to the young, and there are other people who deserve to live and be happy.\"While the athletes will proudly march in the opening ceremonies of the games, they will only participate in the marathon event, so they have chosen to march in the second half of the parade of nations. There are many small states participating in the games, most of which have far smaller populations than East Timor.Still, East Timor's athletes have a strong advantage. The island of Bali, just 100 kilometers away, boasts one of the world's largest marathons every June, so East Timorese runners have had lots of practice.",

His father, Girma, claims that he was tortured to death by police. Girma told FBC in an interview that he visited his son on 6 June at the Police Station where he was being held. He claimed that his son had been tortured, with visible injuries on his body and that he was denied medical treatment. Girma said that his son had been killed following his arrest and that police claims of Behailu dying of typhoid were untrue. The father is adamant that his son had died due to beatings by police.Based on eyewitness accounts, Behailu was stopped and questioned by members of the Addis Abeba Police Commission’s 32nd unit. As police were suspicious of Behailu, they took him into custody along with his mother’s iPhone 8 and his own Galaxy S9. When the phone was returned, his family members claim that there was an SD card missing from the handset. The police arrested Behailu and accused him of robbery, based on the assumption that he was trying to sell the phone for money.",

He described the arms deal as \"transparent, legal and in the strictest respect of public morality.\"Two other defendants, businessman Pierre Falcone and his associate Arcadi Gaydamak, were convicted and handed two-year suspended sentences on Friday and fines of 300,000 and 100,000 euros respectively.Gaydamak and Falcone were convicted of conspiring to \"influence a foreign public agent\" and influence \"a person who was responsible for a public service.\"",

        "text": "The New York Times recently reported a growing interest in Broadway musicals in China. Many Chinese people are drawn to the genre because of its combination of singing and dancing with drama and an emphasis on plot.In August, a Chinese production of The Sound of Music opened in Beijing. The New York Times described the show as being “packed with enough special effects, scenic transitions and lighting cues to challenge a small army of stagehands — something of a miracle in China, where all labor, skilled or otherwise, is expensive.”Much of the dialogue in the production was translated into Chinese, but some of the songs were left in English. The Beijing version also included additional musical numbers from the film, including “I Have Confidence,” as well as new songs that were translated into Chinese.According to The New York Times, The Sound of Music will run in Beijing for at least one year. It will then move on to Shanghai and Hong Kong.In September, Chinese audiences were treated to a musical revue called Broadway, I Love You!, which was an extravaganza of scenes and songs from over 30 shows. This included songs from the classic musicals Hello, Dolly!, Evita, and Dreamgirls. The song “Fugue for Tinhorns” from Guys and Dolls was also included.Broadway, I Love You! was a production of Shanghai Media Group, and featured stars of Chinese stage and screen, with music produced by a 26-piece orchestra. In the song “Money Makes the World Go Round,” the lyrics “Money is the best / For all the rest” were changed to “Piano is the best / For all the rest.” According to The New York Times, this was a reference to the recent purchase of the Steinway piano company by John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire.This fall, the musical Dreamgirls will also open in Beijing.",

The complaint, the 1st in the country to name the California Catholic Conference (CCC) as a defendant, alleges that the statewide organization represents all of the bishops of California and was established to further their shared interest in avoiding scandal, bad publicity, and legal accountability.The plaintiffs are all adults who reside in Northern California, but were abused in the Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, Santa Rosa, Monterey, Fresno, Orange and San Bernardino Dioceses. Their abuse spans decades from the early 1950's to the mid-1980's.\"The sexual violence, exploitation and abuse that has occurred at the hands of Catholic Church personnel is a systemic, institution-wide and worldwide crisis,\" said Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minnesota-based attorney and lead attorney for the plaintiffs.\"The Catholic Church has knowingly engaged in a systematic effort to maintain secrecy and avoid transparency or accountability in an effort to prevent public outrage and to keep lawsuits from ever seeing the light of day in a court of law. This is about protecting children and helping survivors begin to heal. We believe the public has a right to know who the sexual abusers are, what the Church knows and has done, and to gain an understanding of how and why the abuse was not prevented or reported. Disclosing this information is the right thing to do.\"The abuse in California, like most states, was widespread across its Dioceses, and by no means has been adequately disclosed by the Dioceses or the CCC.",

He isolated her from her family and friends. Patrick controlled the family finances and there was evidence that he made threats to Grace and physically assaulted her on some occasions.“It would be no exaggeration to say that Patrick was a violent bully with a controlling nature.”",

Some of the problems governments face are lack of money, poor teacher quality and classroom conditions, a lack of accountability and corruption, and an overcrowded curriculum.At the University of Ghana’s Institute of African Studies, professor Samuel Laryea is well-versed in the problems that African schools and universities face.?The general lack of resources is the main one, and then the general state of the classrooms in most parts of Africa [has] deteriorated, so that even the most motivated of the children will [not be able] to concentrate on what is going on,? said Professor Laryea.?But then, too, I think that the fact that the classroom is [often] not connected to the real life. So that whatever the child is being taught in the classroom does not really relate to his life outside of the classroom.?Ghana’s Ministry of Education says that for every 100 Ghanaian students who enter primary school, only about 60 percent finish and only about 30 percent go on to attend junior high school. Even fewer go to high school.Several studies of the Ghanaian education system show that one-third of students have failed to pass the national standardized test, meaning that they will be unable to pursue higher education.Poor conditions are exacerbated by corruption, as many teachers demand payment in order to pass students.Professor Laryea says that some teachers take advantage of the weak educational system to extract money from parents and students to boost their incomes. In return, the teachers do not feel the need to teach the children much.?[The] teacher will not really get out of the way and not take advantage of parents who are poor in this country to extort money from them, so that they can be allowed to pass the children in their classes,? continued Professor Laryea.?",

        "text": "By Aurel Braun, professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto.The global liberal order may be coming to an end, or perhaps only to a crossroads. A number of countries in Eastern and Western Europe—including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Austria—are displaying tendencies toward illiberal democracy, meaning the substitution of democracy for liberalism. This could portend a significant shift in the geopolitics of Europe, as well as a serious challenge to global liberalism.Illiberal democracy means that the majority of citizens elect governments on the basis of a genuinely open, free, and fair election. That electoral process ensures that the leadership will reflect the will of the majority of citizens.But while the majority may get its preferred government, it does not get liberalism, which embodies political pluralism and individual and minority rights, including protection of property, the rule of law, independent media, and a vibrant civil society.To be clear, a government with majoritarian rule, but also liberal principles, is a liberal democracy; and a government without majoritarian rule, but with liberal principles, is an illiberal liberal order. What makes an illiberal democracy different is that the citizens get to choose their government, but their liberties are at risk.The global liberal order may be coming to an end, or perhaps only to a crossroads.Illiberal democracy is the worst of both worlds. It may have popular legitimacy, but that popular legitimacy comes at the expense of individual rights and freedoms. Citizens can change their government, but they do not necessarily get liberalism.The current illiberal tendencies in Europe should be understood in light of the historical trend in this region and the world more generally.",

Jambon allegedly said, \"I'm just telling it like it is: immigrants cause higher crime rates.\" Credit: Creative Commons.by Laura Daley and Jillian GibersonThe recent terror attack in London has put Belgium’s Deputy Prime Minister Jan Jambon on the defensive after he said refugees in the country often end up in jail.Last year, in the wake of a series of terrorist attacks in Brussels, Jambon came under fire for saying he wanted to deport convicted terrorists.At the time, he claimed that all 135,000 asylum seekers in the country should be vetted for terror connections. This, he claimed, was “for the sake of the security of our citizens.”A little over a year later, he is facing similar heat, including from members of his own party, over his recent comments about how refugees have an unfavourable impact on society.On Tuesday, Jambon, who was visiting the Belgian coastal city of Zeebrugge, was quoted as saying, “I’m just telling it like it is: immigrants cause higher crime rates.”He pointed to statistics in Belgium’s second-largest city Antwerp that showed asylum seekers accounted for 10 per cent of the population but committed 60 to 70 per cent of the crime.His comments came a day after a terror attack in London that killed four people, including the attacker, and injured more than 40.The attacker was identified as Khalid Masood, a British man who, according to reports, used to be a teacher.In response to Jambon’s comments, Belgium’s Interior Minister, Jan Jambon, said Jambon had a point, but that linking immigrants to crime was a “stigmatization.”",

Mao Zedong, the mercurial Chinese communist leader who established the People's Republic of China in 1949 and ruled over a generation of Chinese people, died in 1976. Yet nearly three decades later, the Chinese public still isn't completely allowed to remember the man, even if he does rest beneath a granite mausoleum at the heart of the nation's capital. China's Communist Party leaders have tried to strike a balance between extolling Mao's virtues — he did, after all, establish the People's Republic — and vilifying his excesses — millions of people were persecuted in the Cultural Revolution, a period of political madness that Mao unleashed from 1966 to 1976.That ambivalence toward Mao's life and works was again evident on Dec. 2 — the Chinese leader's birthday, or so party bosses say — when authorities at Renmin University in Beijing detained Luo Haiqing, a well known left-wing student activist who had been calling on people to remember Mao. \"We think he is a good man, and he fought for the liberation of China,\" says Ren Jianming, a 21-year-old classmate of Luo's. \"But if we put up posters or write articles, the police will come to arrest us.\"That's not always the case.",

But he says the rebels have been promised rewards if the agreement is implemented.\"Sudan has been under the shadow of U.S. sanctions for a long time and it remains to be seen what we will do with respect to Sudan and we can deal with that at the appropriate time,\" said Mr. Danforth.",

The flooding has impacted election planning. More than 10 million voters have been registered for the October 28 presidential and parliamentary elections.Mozambique is a country in southeastern Africa bordering on the Indian Ocean. Since the civil war ended in 1992, the country has been considered a stable democracy with economic reforms being implemented by President Armando Guebuza.The main opposition party, Mozambique’s National Resistance (Renamo), has been struggling to be considered a serious contender with the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since independence. During the 1994 presidential elections, Renamo accused the Frelimo government of electoral fraud and abandoned their campaign.Renamo and the National Elections Commission have had a difficult relationship, which was evident after a visit by the leader of Renamo. Upon leaving the meeting, Renamo members were held up in the parking lot for more than an hour and a half without receiving any explanation.A week later, the Renamo party was not granted access to all documents that the commission was to provide. These documents are necessary for the planning of the campaign trail. The Renamo party’s spokesman, Fernando Mazanga, expressed his disappointment: “The fact that we were not given all the information we required is worrying. That means that we must keep a watchful eye and remain alert as the date of the election approaches.”The National Elections Commission, which was appointed by the president, is also receiving criticism from a local election observer organization, the Mozambique Election Observation Network, which stated it was “deeply concerned by the lack of communication and transparency between the commission and the various political parties.”The National Elections Commission is already preparing a new voter registry and has been receiving financial support from the United Nations Development Program. However, one major factor contributing to the unequal election process is money.",

The election marks Malawi's first-ever transition from one elected leader to another, and could set a precedent for other African countries facing a change in government. Malawi's first multiparty election in 1994 was praised as a model in democratic governance. Now the tiny southern African nation is striving to make this transition peaceful and orderly as well.It was a sunny day as Malawian President Bakili Muluzi made his final round on the campaign trail. The candidate of the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) is running for a third term, which critics say is unconstitutional.But the issue seems to have lost its grip on voters. Mr. Muluzi is running against his vice president, a breakaway candidate within his party, and an independent candidate.Vice President Justin Malewezi's supporters were out in force. But the atmosphere was mostly calm and relaxed as Malawians prepared to head to the polls.The voters were eager to choose a new leader, after 10 years of President Muluzi's rule.\"I think I will go for the president. I think that is where we need the change because he has done enough. For 10 years he was ruling us, and now it is time for others to take the lead,\" said one voter.And another said, \"I want a change of the president, but I want the UDF to continue governing, so I want the other person, Justin Malewezi, to take the lead.\"The electoral commission had predicted a high voter turnout and was expecting problems.

Ping was speaking at a meeting of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. The gathering brought together 45 Ministers in Africa as well as leading experts in economic planning and development.Ping said that heads of State can no longer afford to leave their ministers alone to handle the day-to-day economic development and planning activities. He argued that a greater involvement by the African heads of State is needed to speed up the integration of the continent.“It’s time for our heads of State to be involved in the formulation of this plan as no Ministers’ meeting can substitute the active involvement of the Heads of State, we need the commitment of the Heads of State if we want to move forward, as it is they who will present this plan to the African people for their approval,” said Ping.In order to address the continent’s economic challenges, Ping reiterated the need for member states to prioritize industrial development for the continent.“Africa cannot continue to rely on exports of raw materials because we lose a lot of foreign currency that would have otherwise come back to our continent as finished products. We must produce finished products from our raw materials if we are to fully exploit our resources,” said Ping.In his presentation, the AUC’s Commissioner for Economic Affairs, H.E.

And empowerment comes from within, but we can empower ourselves through knowledge, skills, being confident and being prepared to work for our common goals,” she added.The Margibi lawmaker said, however, that in her personal view, the only thing that would push Liberian women forward to meet their goals is for them to start being more confident.“If we go for interviews, we always doubt ourselves, thinking we will never get the job or that the job is for someone else. This mentality has to be a thing of the past,” Senator Cooper stressed.In the country today, only a handful of female politicians currently hold elective positions, among them Senator Cooper, Bong County Representative, Virginia Sawyer, Grand Cape Mount County District Representative, A.

The protester will have to come to the National Assembly to replace it and pay for it.”He also said the National Assembly would continue to try to keep protesters from disturbing sessions.“Even though they may be shouting or using a bullhorn or protesting in the hallway, there is no need to interrupt the National Assembly,” he said.A protester involved in the incident told RFA that he had planned to turn in a petition to the assembly to request that lawmakers suspend their approval of the development project. But after he was denied entry to the assembly, he was forced to throw the chair on the floor instead.“",

It also appeared on the South China Morning Post.China has long used the “one China principle” as a diplomatic litmus test for countries seeking closer ties to Beijing, warning that formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan would undermine relations.However, U.S.-Taiwan relations have expanded so substantially in recent years that some suggest the U.S. could very soon take a major step that has been taboo for decades—formally recognizing the sovereign Republic of China on Taiwan.Taiwan’s relations with the U.S. hit a high point at the end of the Obama administration, but they are reaching new highs under Donald Trump.This expansion began quietly during the Obama administration, which signaled its support for Taiwan’s new diplomatic strategies to expand its international engagement.It grew to new levels with the election of Donald Trump, who has appointed officials known for their support of Taiwan and who personally has suggested that the U.S. might abandon the “one China” policy in the future.Tsai Ing-wen’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is traditionally more favorable to independence, won both the presidential and parliamentary elections in Taiwan in early 2016.Since then, Tsai and her government have promoted new diplomatic strategies for enhancing Taiwan’s relations with countries around the world.One of the pillars of these new strategies is “substantive relations” with the U.S., a term Taiwan has embraced for many years but never fully implemented.Under this new approach, Taiwanese leaders would visit the U.S. more often and meet U.S. government officials, including at high levels.These officials, in turn, would visit Taiwan more often. The two sides would hold talks and negotiate agreements on practical issues, such as technology sharing, and participate in joint military and training exercises.It is not just the Tsai government pushing forward on Taiwan-U.S. relations.",

The group, however, does not seem interested in heeding James Mattis’ advice and has already rejected his offer for a new round of talks.The new US Defense Secretary, James Mattis, has offered to hold a dialogue with the Taliban to bring an end to the 16-year-long war in Afghanistan. Mattis’ offer comes after the Taliban said it “is committed to a peaceful resolution through talks if the invasion of our homeland is ceased.”Mattis’ remarks were made on Thursday during a conference call with reporters.“We are willing to hold talks with the Taliban. We have made that clear. However, I want the Taliban to understand that what’s going to happen this year is the Taliban’s going to be under more pressure than they’ve ever been under before,” he said.The Pentagon chief expressed doubt that the Taliban would be willing to negotiate with the Afghan government, adding that “the only way you solve this is you kill them or talk to them until they stop.”“My assessment is that the Taliban recognizes they cannot win at the battlefield. The battlefield will at some point be rolled back. And the sooner they recognize that and come to negotiating, the fewer casualties we will have, the quicker we can end this thing for good, and bring them into the government if they want to come in. We are willing to hold talks with the Taliban. We have made that clear. But I want the Taliban to know that what is going to happen this year is the Taliban is going to be under more pressure than they have been under,” he stressed.At the same time, the US diplomat said that the White House is planning to increase the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan, with a goal of “reducing casualties” among Afghan security forces.",

Tillerson also hinted that reversing the limited progress achieved under the Obama administration could be in the cards. “We’re going to work to support the people of Cuba, and that’s what most important to me,” Tillerson said. “It’s supporting them in their aspirations, which are to return to a free Cuba.”The New York Times characterized Tillerson’s statements as “striking and unequivocal,” pointing out the Trump administration’s stance is likely to depart from the Obama administration’s efforts to normalize relations. “While the Obama administration has been accused of ‘appeasing’ the Cuban government, Mr. Tillerson took a tougher tack toward the small Communist country, implying that President-elect Trump would be more concerned with the aspirations of the Cuban people,” it wrote.According to Tillerson, Cuba’s economic relationship with the Venezuelan regime was cause for concern. He described Cuba as a “terrible neighbor” to Venezuela, stating “it would be a very positive change for the entire Western Hemisphere if Cuba…could become a more democratic country.” He added, “Whether that will be the case remains to be seen. But nothing in my conversations with President-elect Trump leaves me with the impression that he will not be taking a fresh look at all of our relationships in the hemisphere.”Tillerson was also asked what the United States should do regarding Venezuela, and he made it clear the United States would keep an eye on the situation.",

However I think that the argument in the article doesn’t go far enough. Yes indeed, the Chinese investment is in line with the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) (now PASDEP) which was drafted by the Ethiopian government. But to reduce the role of Ethiopia in this venture to the mere drafting of a developmental plan is not only incomplete but also unfair to the Ethiopian people.There are two things that need to be clarified: First, that the GTP (PASDEP) doesn’t only cover infrastructure development. It also covers the socio economic development such as healthcare, education etc. So it is not correct to say that GTP(PASDEP) is mainly concentrated on infrastructure development. Secondly it is not correct to say that the Chinese support for the growth and transformation plan is simply part of its global effort to stimulate development in Africa. China supported the Ethiopian government’s growth and transformation plan because China has a strategic interest in investing in Ethiopia: which is to open a trade route to the Arabian Sea via Ethiopia and Djibouti and on the way use the port facilities and the Ethiopian domestic market to stimulate its own economy. China sees Ethiopia’s infrastructure development as a way to facilitate its own economic growth and access to the African market. This means that the developmental agenda that you see is not only the agenda of the Ethiopian government. It is also the agenda of the Chinese government and it is Ethiopia that decided how the support will look like.",

Soft US data contrast with generally firmer readings abroad, highlighting the case for a gradual unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet and limited prospects of the FOMC moving quickly in raising policy rates. For the Fed, the deterioration of recent US data would likely require further improvement in global growth.Fed Policy Gradual, but Risk Remains of Early Unwinding of Balance SheetThe FOMC statement and forecasts released following the March meeting on 15 March struck a positive tone, but the Fed’s updated forecasts revealed a less aggressive stance on interest rates than indicated in December. Given the Fed’s intention to move the policy rate to more normal levels while at the same time reducing the size of its balance sheet, the prospects of more than three additional rate hikes over the next two years seems unlikely. Indeed, if the Fed begins to reduce the size of its balance sheet later this year, this could result in a more hawkish stance by the FOMC.Retail Sales WeakThe March retail sales report was weak. Headline retail sales fell short of expectations and the level of sales relative to spending is now at the lowest in more than two years (Figure 1). While the level of retail sales is volatile, the trend has declined in recent years (Figure 2).

But beyond all the campaigning by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in support of this, other major changes taking place have attracted less attention. Critics of the AKP government, however, are sounding alarm bells.The critics are saying that a hidden agenda is in operation to move Turkey away from its secular identity.One of the most crucial items in the agenda is a change in the national education system. In a series of changes and new regulations, the AKP government is said to be trying to open the doors of national education to sectarian imams of the religious community.In January this year, the government, without any official announcement, allowed students of religious high schools, or imam-hatips, to enter the exams to access public universities. This came after an amendment to the law on higher education allowing this, which was brought in 10 days before exams were due to start. It was also learned that there had been a change in the student admission criteria. Whereas up until 2015 candidates for access to universities could take the exam twice, from now they will be allowed to take it three times.These moves are part of a package of changes aimed at allowing the imams to enter higher education, a critic of the AKP government, Can Peker, said. Peker, who is the editor in chief of a political affairs website, Siyaset.org, wrote that “the hidden agenda of AKP on national education is becoming clearer day by day.”",

If unaddressed, they can lead to a vicious cycle of repeated and even worsening violations.“Human rights violations are part of the conflict that we are seeing throughout the Middle East. We are witnessing the death of multicultural, multi-religious societies and we need to reconstruct those societies and not allow them to disappear.”Zeid said the world should make every effort to protect human rights and prevent further bloodshed, and that the international community must ensure the safety of people in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and other regions of conflict. He urged the countries in the region to ensure accountability for those responsible for the abuses.“Human rights violations are part of the conflict that we are seeing throughout the Middle East,” he said. “We are witnessing the death of multicultural, multi-religious societies and we need to reconstruct those societies and not allow them to disappear.”In Yemen, he said, the continuing fighting and escalation of human rights violations are a “horrifying testimony to the devastation and bloodshed” caused by war. Over the last two months, the war has killed more than 1,200 civilians, wounded 5,000 and forced more than 500,000 people from their homes.“This is a time for action, for justice and for accountability,” Zeid said. “We must stop the vicious cycle of oppression and violence. We must prevent a new cycle of conflict in the region.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON – As North Korean troops have mobilized near the South Korean border, threatening war, U.S. nuclear analysts have expressed doubt about the regime’s ability to effectively launch a nuclear weapon.Though the world still fears the reclusive nation’s ability to attack through conventional warfare and, in a worst-case scenario, launch a non-conventional nuclear attack, experts who spoke to CQ Roll Call pointed out the technological barriers for such an attack.“North Korea can probably mount a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile and shoot it at something,” said Jon Wolfsthal, nuclear security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The big question is, can they actually explode the warheads? North Korea is making progress, but not there yet.”“That said, we don’t really know what they can do,” Wolfsthal said. “They’ve hidden their capabilities really well and we should assume they can do more than they’ve shown.”In 2009, then-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that the “DPRK may already have that capability” to mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile. In an email interview with CQ Roll Call this week, Gates said it’s a “reasonable inference” to expect that the country could launch a successful attack.“This is a key point and it explains why we keep looking for a way to reduce the North’s arsenal of nuclear weapons,” said Gates, who is co-author of the recently released memoir “Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.” “The more warheads they have, the greater the risk that they would be able to mount and detonate them on their missiles.”In fact, U.S. officials who spoke to CQ Roll Call said the greatest fear comes from the possibility of a conventional attack, not a nuclear one.“No one believes North Korea is in a position to launch a nuclear weapon capable of doing a lot of damage to anyone,” said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, which advocates for nuclear security.",

Over the past year, UNMEER has made a significant contribution to the global response to the Ebola epidemic by playing a critical role in assisting our international and national partners in the fight against the disease. The Mission has served as a key player in international coordination, helped to scale-up a critical workforce, supported the logistical infrastructure for international and national actors, and worked with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and others to create an Emergency Response Platform that has served as a framework for coordinating the recovery effort.As the crisis in Liberia continues to stabilize, now is the time for the international community to turn its focus to helping the government and people of Liberia to recover and rebuild the health systems, economy and society that the epidemic disrupted.During her meeting last week with Secretary General Ban and President Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power made clear that we cannot be complacent even as the epidemic declines. The threat of future outbreaks remains, and we must continue to make use of the lessons we are learning in the current response to ensure that countries are better prepared and able to rapidly control future outbreaks.Toward this end, Ambassador Power announced that the United States will invest an additional $5 million in support of WHO, FAO, and the West African Health Organization to help strengthen preparedness and response capacity in at-risk countries in the region. We look forward to working with WHO and FAO as they help countries in the region develop strategies and prepare the infrastructure, equipment, and materials needed to respond to an Ebola outbreak.But it is not enough to focus our efforts and resources solely on containment.",

The legislation, formally known as the Repeal Bill, is currently being debated in the House of Commons.\"I am not a quitter,\" May said in her speech. \"And there is much more to do to get Brexit right.\"EU officials have said the negotiations cannot move onto trade until Britain makes progress on the exit terms, including its bill.

The resolution was the result of an agreement worked out between the U.S. and Great Britain on the one hand, and France, Germany and Russia on the other.The measure adopted by the Security Council is based on the old 1990 resolution that established a program of UN inspections of Iraqi weapons sites. But it has been revised by language, agreed to during three days of intensive negotiations, that is supposed to clear away obstacles to a resumption of the inspections, which broke down four years ago.The new text says there should be a new arrangement between Iraq and the UN, which would require Iraq to submit a declaration of all its weapons of mass destruction programs within 30 days after the new inspection body is put in place.U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte says that arrangement should be designed by the UN with Iraq's approval, but it must be consistent with the obligations set down in previous Security Council resolutions.\"Therefore, for example,\" he said, \"Iraq must provide inspectors with immediate and unrestricted access to all sites and people in Iraq that they wish to inspect, and also provide the inspectors with immediate and unfettered access to any site or people that they suspect may be related to proscribed weapons programs.\"Ambassador Negroponte's French counterpart, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, welcomed the unanimous vote. But he expressed reservations about language that could set the stage for the use of force if Iraq fails to comply. He pointed out that the resolution sets out a path to peace, but that, if things were to go awry, the \"last resort\" of enforcement would be available.At an impromptu news conference on the doorstep of the U.S.",

In the cities of Hadramout, Marib, Shabwah, al-Jawf and Sanaa's Sawad district, people have demonstrated against the Houthis' assault on the state's official institutions.Tribesmen in these regions have rejected the Houthis' authority. There are no pro-Houthi tribes in the areas mentioned, despite the fact that there are some individual tribesmen who support them.Yemen's official state institutions are based upon the tribal structure. How has the tribal situation changed following the Houthis' coup?The Houthis have tried to establish a new structure, but this has led to a weakening of state institutions. This has resulted in a weakening of the central government.The tribal system, however, has remained untouched by the coup. This system was the main source of support for President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi when he resigned.The Houthis wanted to make the tribal system an alternative to the official government, and this is why they tried to build alliances with the tribes, or at least certain figures within the tribes.In fact, this was one of the Houthis' primary mistakes. Tribes do not belong to individuals, and the tribal system itself does not give them the right to make political decisions.Furthermore, a tribe's authority does not automatically include a ruler, which was a fundamental factor in the Houthis' failure. The tribes want a strong central government and do not accept the Houthis' coup, and this explains why the government has so far retained the majority of tribes' support.There have been reports about battles between pro-government and pro-Houthi tribesmen.",

He was actually born in Marktl am Inn, located in the Bavarian region. His birth name was Joseph Ratzinger and he is the first Pope to have been born in Germany for almost 1,000 years. Born just six years before the start of the second world war, he actually grew up during the war years, and was eventually conscripted into an anti aircraft unit, and was even held as a prisoner of war. His brother Georg however, didn't survive the war.He was eventually released from the unit, and was able to join a seminary. He was ordained as a priest in 1951, and began his career as a teacher of theology. It was in 1953 that he received his Doctorate of Sacred Theology from the Angelicum University of Rome. He later became a professor of theological dogma and history of dogma at the University of Bonn, as well as several other universities in Munster, Salzbug, Tubingen and Regensburg.He served as Archbishop in Munich for a number of years, before being nominated as a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II. A short while after that, he became the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, which was once the office of the Holy Inquisition. It is also the office that is responsible for promoting Catholicism and correcting any false doctrines.While Pope John Paul II had always been a very popular and well liked Pope, the same could not always be said of Joseph Ratzinger. As part of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, he was responsible for taking care of a wide variety of controversial topics that had sprung up during the papacy of John Paul II. These topics and issues included abortion, same sex marriage, the ordination of women and a number of other hot button issues within the Catholic faith.During the election of Pope Benedict XVI, there was a great deal of speculation and controversy as to who would ultimately become the new Pope.",

The secretary general said he wants Asian governments to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs with the following priorities:• To put job creation at the forefront of their development policy as a means of promoting equitable growth;• To improve governance and reduce corruption;• To promote the role of women in development; and• To develop renewable sources of energy and expand clean energy technologies, with a focus on energy efficiency.Ban called on the assembled leaders to seize the opportunity to mobilize public support to ensure that the United Nations continues to play a leading role in the region and that its vision for inclusive and sustainable development is achieved.ESCAP's mission is to foster economic cooperation and integrate disadvantaged states in Asia and the Pacific, particularly those with landlocked, island or mountainous developing economies.ESCAP's current membership comprises 62 regional member States, nine associate members, and three of the UN's five Regional Economic and Social Commissions, namely the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Economic Commission for Africa, and the Economic Commission for Europe.Through the ESCAP secretariat, the commission is mandated to provide a forum for all the countries of the region to review and discuss the development issues and activities of ESCAP and report and make recommendations to the UN Economic and Social Council.The 64th session of ESCAP continues through Friday.",

The reduction will take effect at the beginning of the new year.The Reserve Bank Governor, Duvvuri Subbarao, said that inflation has remained at elevated levels, and that there are some upside risks to the current inflationary outlook.Even though the central bank in India has raised interest rates a stunning 13 times in the last 18 months, inflation remains above 9 percent. India is trying to balance the need to stimulate economic growth with keeping inflation in check.Analysts warn however, that this is a delicate balancing act. For instance, there is concern that the recent increase in interest rates and reduced cash reserve ratio might actually end up inflaming inflation.",

Lee has said he may run for president in the 2008 election.The island's opposition parties, including Lee's, want to hold a referendum on the March 20 presidential election to allow voters to oust Chen midway through his second four-year term. They say Chen misused his powers in seeking re-election and want him to resign immediately.Chen was elected on a strongly pro-independence platform, and has angered Beijing by vowing to seek a new constitution and change the island's name to the Republic of Taiwan.The United States, Taiwan's closest unofficial ally, and other major powers also have expressed concern over Chen's stance, saying he should avoid moves that put the island at risk of conflict with China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.Police put the turnout at around 100,000 people, in addition to several thousand pro-independence protesters who also turned out Saturday in a largely peaceful show of force in downtown Taipei.Police used barricades to keep apart supporters of Chen and supporters of the main opposition Nationalist Party, which is allied with Lee.",

On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be?

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him.

It is the first time a victim of sex trafficking has received damages from the tribunal. Phil Mercer reports from Sydney.Jetsadophorn Chaladone was brought to Australia with her father's permission in 1995 and had hoped to be employed as a nanny.Instead she was put to work in a brothel by a gang of traffickers and was told she had to pay off a $28,000 debt.Australian immigration officials raided the brothel just over a week later. By then, Jetsadophorn had been forced to have sex with dozens of men.The New South Wales Victims Compensation Tribunal has recognized the depression and post-traumatic stress she suffered as a result. The tribunal has ordered that Jetsadophorn be paid compensation from a government fund for crime victims. The amount has not been disclosed.She now lives in northern Thailand and has said the money will help pay for her son's education.Her story was told in the documentary \"Trafficked\" by film maker Luigi Acquisto.He told journalists the tribunal's decision is an important victory for this young victim of Australia's sex trade.\"She felt that she'd done something wrong, she felt ashamed, and she carried that with her for a long time, even though she was only 13 at the time when she was trafficked,\" he said. \"And now she realizes, because of the affirmation by I guess Australia, that she was in fact a victim, that she didn't do anything wrong, and that justice, to some extent, has been done.\"",

The association was angry that three students were arrested Monday for taking their own security measures to control theft on a university campus.Tuesday, the same students staged a violent protest, slashing tires in front of a private high school in Abidjan where teachers have gone on strike to force the adoption of school uniforms.The teachers say they are attacked by unidentified assailants when they give out poor grades, and that only uniformed students should be allowed inside the school to prevent such incidents.Meanwhile, students displaced by the 17-month Ivorian civil war, who have been denied aid money promised to them last year, are boycotting classes this week. They say they have been living in wretched conditions, sometimes 10 to a small room, and some of them have even turned to prostitution.School protests are not unique to Ivory Coast.

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately. At the time of the shooting, the market was full of many people, including many young girls and women buying and selling produce,\" said Colville.

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government.

And, there have been cases of contractor abuse ranging from violence to cultural insensitivity that have given the private security industry a bad name among many Afghans.Karzai set this month as the deadline for private security firms to be replaced with the interior ministry's new Afghan Private Protection Force or APPF. That deadline has been extended for up to 90 days to facilitate the transition. But more than 50 private security companies will be dissolved and more than 10,000 security guards will be re-assigned or replaced.Brigadier General Carsten Jacobson, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, says this is an important milestone in the process of transferring all security responsibilities to Afghan forces before most international combats troops withdraw in 2014. ?The APPF is focusing now on taking over security responsibility for development projects, convoys and commercial businesses,\" said Jacobson. \"By March 2013 all security for ISAF bases and construction sites are scheduled to transition to the APPF.?Of course the service is not free. Companies and the interior ministry have for months been negotiating how the process will work and how much it will cost.",

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

She said the use of both air-dropped and ground-launched cluster munitions had increased since Russia joined Syrian military operations in 2015, but that their use had fallen off this year.\"There are several reasons for that,\" she said. \"One is that … the territory held by the opposition forces has been shrinking in the past year.

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks. Families of victims complain of slow and ineffective police investigations.A student holds a portrait of a University Professor A.F.M.

Tapping reserves is a rare move in the island nation, one of the few in the world where the constitution requires the state to balance its official budget.Singapore is among the first countries predicted to have negative economic growth due to the pandemic.

The Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak, says three people to date have died in Singapore.Earlier this week, the government allowed a weaker currency in order to facilitate exports and said it would spend 11% of gross domestic product to limit the economic harm caused by COVID-19.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources.

The WFP relief teams have provided food aid to about 300,000 in the last four months, but must now increase funding to feed at least a million needy, she says. “And the most challenging issue is that we do not have the resources to support the purchase of commodities …” says Cousin. To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

Authorities later arrived at one of Fernandez’ homes in southern Santa Cruz province.The alleged scheme is based on an investigation by a local newspaper into corruption during the administrations of Fernandez and her late husband, Nestor Kirchner. The investigation found that someone who helped deliver bags of cash to former officials in exchange for public contracts from 2005 to 2015 kept detailed notebooks.",

I write with songwriters; I play with other good musicians,'' Starr told Reuters, noting \"because it's what I do.'' \"It's very hard for me to find a stranger these days because I've been around a long time.'' Starr has witnessed the music industry evolve dramatically over his 50-year career, and consumption is becoming increasingly digital with Apple Inc's iTunes and Amazon.com Inc as well as online streaming platforms such as Spotify and Jay Z's newly-announced Tidal. The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes. Starr himself still prefers purchasing physical copies of music. \"Streaming I don't understand anymore. All I ever hear is that your record has been streamed 17 million times and they give you a check for 12 bucks,'' he said. \"With the established musicians, that seems to be the problem. And the bigger problem with that is there's nothing coming in for the new bands.''",

The regional talks were initially expected to focus on countering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but recent turmoil in Pakistan has generated concern that Islamabad's problems are more serious. Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country. And it's not just that they are in FATA, the tribal areas. They are in our cities and that is even more dangerous.\" Pakistan has battled Taliban militants in its northwest tribal areas since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the fighting is now moving closer to population centers, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee.Professor Hoodbhoy says the government for years tried to ignore or minimize the spreading influence of the militants, without acknowledging that the situation continued to worsen. \"The present situation is where religious extremists - whether they be the Taliban or whether they be one of the very many other jihaidst groups that were early on nurtured by the Pakistan army - they are pretty much beyond control now,\" Hoodbhoy said.",
