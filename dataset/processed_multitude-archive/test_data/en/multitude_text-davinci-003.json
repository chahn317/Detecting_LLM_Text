Incumbent President Petro Poroshenko has claimed that exit polls are evidence that he has won, while his opponent Volodymyr Zelensky has also declared himself the winner.The two men have been locked in a tense battle for the presidency since the first round of voting in March. The latest survey, conducted by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, gave Poroshenko a 5% lead over Zelensky, with the incumbent on 53.7%, and Zelensky on 48.7%.However, the Ukrainian Central Election Commission has yet to declare a clear winner. This could mean that the final results may take a few days or weeks to confirm. There are also some concerns that the election was marred by irregularities, which could delay the final announcement even further.With both candidates claiming victory and a high level of uncertainty, tensions remain high in Ukraine. The country is anxiously awaiting a decision from the Election Commission that can settle the dispute and bring some level of stability to the region.",

The explosion occurred deep inside the Zasyadko mine, located near Donetsk in the Donetsk region.Authorities say they believe the cause of the accident was likely methane buildup. The miners were working at a depth of 500-700 metres when the blast occurred.Rescuers and emergency services rushed to the site of the accident in the morning but it took them several hours to reach the group of miners due to the rubble blocking the entrances and exits.",

In recent weeks, thousands of asylum seekers have arrived in the small country, placing a strain on public services and sparking a backlash from certain politicians.Refugees, particularly those from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, are worried about the rhetoric that is being used in Belgium against them. Many fear a roll back of policies which provide them with a safe place to live and work.“It's very worrying to hear people referring to refugees as a 'threat',” said Faisal, a Syrian refugee living in Brussels. “I don't know what is going to happen next. All I want is a safe and secure place to live and work.”The Belgian government has promised to continue to provide assistance to refugees, but some politicians have called for restrictions and tougher security measures. “We must ensure that our borders are secure and that we know who is coming into our country,” said Minister of Immigration, Theo Francken.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has criticized this rhetoric and warned that it could lead to a dangerous atmosphere of xenophobia in the country. “Refugees should be seen as victims of conflict and violence, not as a threat to our security or economy,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “They deserve our protection and assistance.” In the face of increased tensions, refugees are still hoping for a safe place in Belgium. “I just want to be able to live my life in peace,” said Faisal.",

Gates credited this decline to investment in health and education through international development programs.“If these resources and the progress they’ve enabled are not sustained, many of the gains we’ve achieved will be reversed,\" Gates said.Gates called for governments to ensure that there is adequate funding for global health initiatives, agricultural research, and family planning programs.

Recent years have seen an increase in violence and instability, leading to a situation in which the government struggles to maintain control of even its capital, Kabul.It is against this backdrop that President Joe Biden is now considering a new strategy. Biden has signaled that he is open to the idea of a reduced US military presence in Afghanistan, with a focus on counterterrorism operations as well as diplomatic and economic pressure.Several regional leaders have backed the idea of a reduced US footprint in Afghanistan, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has called for \"a peace process without preconditions that brings an end to the conflict and establishes a government able to protect its citizens and deny safe haven to terrorists.\"However, it remains to be seen what the new strategy will be and how it will be implemented. A number of questions remain, including whether the Taliban will be willing to negotiate and what kind of political settlement might be possible. As the situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, attention will no doubt intensify further on the strategy that the US and its allies decide to pursue.",

        "text": "In a landmark ruling on Thursday, the US Supreme Court determined that police must obtain a warrant before tracking an individual's cellphone location. The 5-4 decision delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts found that, when considering an individual's \"legitimate expectations of privacy,\" a warrant is required for the government to access such sensitive information.The case in question, Carpenter v. US, revolved around the conviction of Timothy Carpenter, who was accused of several armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio in 2011 and 2012. The FBI relied on evidence obtained by accessing 127 days worth of Carpenter's cellphone records, pinpointing his location and establishing his presence near the crime scenes. Carpenter argued that this amounted to an illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts agreed, stating that \"when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone...it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone’s user.\" In his dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argued that the decision was too sweeping, going beyond the Fourth Amendment's original scope. The court's ruling will likely have a huge impact on law enforcement in the US, as cellphone location records are increasingly used in criminal investigations. Technology companies, too, are likely to be affected, as some have been known to store location records for upwards of seven years. Nevertheless, the ruling establishes a precedent that places strong emphasis on protecting individual privacy in the digital age.",

        "text": "Italian researchers have made a breakthrough in the field of robotics, developing a robotic hand that is lighter and cheaper than the models currently available on the market. The team at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) designed the new robotic hand to resemble a human hand, providing users with a realistic motion capability and aesthetic. The creators of the device, Dr. Darwin Caldwell and Dr. Matteo Laffranchi, managed to make the robotic hand smaller, lighter and cheaper compared to similar models.The robotic hand is composed of four motors to move each finger, nine actuators for each joint, two for the wrist, and a force sensor in the thumb. While it costs around €2,000 to €2,500, its counterparts generally cost more than €3,000. Dr. Caldwell and Dr. Laffranchi hope that the new robotic hand will be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as prosthetics, manufacturing and rescue missions.“We designed the hand to reduce size, weight, complexity, and cost, but still allowing for life-like motions and dexterous grasping,” said Dr. Caldwell. The researchers are currently exploring the potential of using the robotic hand in medical applications, such as tele-rehabilitation, and are confident that their device will have a wide range of uses.",

Tensions have been steadily escalating since last year and Biden is calling for an immediate ceasefire.The US government has urged all parties to step back from the brink of further violence, and start work on a lasting peace. It has urged all actors to refrain from further escalating the conflict, and focus on establishing a meaningful dialogue for a lasting solution.The US has also requested the assistance of the United Nations and other international organizations in mediating an end to the violence. The US Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has already held talks with representatives of both sides in an attempt to help de-escalate the situation.In his statement, the President said: \"I am deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict in South Ossetia, and urge all parties to work together to put an end to it. We must strive for an immediate ceasefire and to seek a negotiated solution to the underlying political issues. It is essential that all sides come to the table in good faith and show willingness to take meaningful steps to reduce the tensions and build a better future for the people of South Ossetia.\"Biden's plea comes as the situation in South Ossetia remains highly volatile, with daily reports of shelling and small arms fire. There is a real fear that the conflict could spread further, as both sides blame each other for its origin.It is hoped that the US President's appeal will be heeded by all parties, and that a lasting peace can be found. For the people of South Ossetia, this could mean the end of years of violence and bloodshed.",

The United States National Transportation Safety Board released its final report on the incident earlier today. The plane, a small single-engine Piper PA-32, took off from a small airfield in Teterboro, New Jersey on the afternoon of March 23rd. It was headed for Dutchess County Airport in Wappingers Falls. The plane flew into a flock of Canada geese shortly after takeoff. The birds were sucked into the engine, causing it to fail, and the plane plunged into the Hudson River. All three occupants of the aircraft—the pilot and two passengers—were killed. In the NTSB’s report, the agency cited a “failure of the engine to produce power due to ingestion of multiple Canada geese.” The investigators found that the geese were “flying at a relatively low altitude,” and that the pilot had no opportunity to avoid the birds. The NTSB also noted that while the crash was “consistent with a loss of engine power,” a second factor could have contributed to the crash. That factor was “the pilot’s delayed decision to attempt a forced landing in the Hudson River.” The report marks the end of the NTSB’s investigation into the crash. The agency’s findings confirm the initial speculation of bird ingestion as the cause of the crash.",

On Saturday, at least 129 people were killed by ISIS militants in a series of coordinated attacks throughout the city.In response to the attacks, many countries in the region have become increasingly critical of the West’s foreign policy in the Middle East. This has been exacerbated by the recent influx of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.For instance, the foreign minister of Iran, Javad Zarif, released a statement condemning the Paris attacks and the Western response to them. He also said that, by placing an emphasis on military action, the West has failed to address the root causes of terrorism.Meanwhile, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, blamed Western policies for creating the conditions that led to the Paris attacks. He has also called for a new international system to address the issue of terrorism.The statements by Zarif and Erdogan represent a broader trend of anti-West sentiment that has grown in the region. The political climate has become increasingly tense, with many people in the Middle East feeling that the West has failed to address the root causes of terrorism and that its policies have made their region even more unstable.The effects of this growing backlash are already being felt. In the last few days, protests have broken out in several countries, including Lebanon and Jordan, in response to the Paris attacks and Western policy.Ultimately, this anti-West sentiment is likely to have long-term consequences for the region and for the West’s relations with the Middle East.

For centuries, they have relied on the river’s annual floods to help irrigate their crops. But now, the mega-dam project threatens to disrupt those vital seasonal cycles.The mega-dam, located in Ethiopia, is the largest of its kind in Africa. The project is expected to store 74 billion cubic meters of water, reducing downstream flow in Egypt by 20-25%. Egypt is the only country in the region to depend solely on the Nile River for agricultural irrigation, so the country’s farmers are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of the project.Rice farming in Egypt is already facing significant challenges, even without the disruption caused by the dam. Despite impressive growth in the industry in recent years, many farmers are finding it difficult to break even. The main culprit is a lack of access to modern irrigation systems, forcing most to rely on floodwater as their primary source of irrigation.The Nile dam project, in combination with recent droughts, has exacerbated the water crisis in Egypt. It has also made it harder for farmers to access water for their crops. Without enough water, their yields are going down and it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living.The crisis has been further exacerbated by sky-rocketing prices for basic goods. With incomes falling, many farmers have had to abandon their land and seek work in other parts of the country.The impact of the dam on Egypt’s rice farmers has been devastating, but the government is taking steps to address the issue. It has invested heavily in modern irrigation systems, as well as in developing innovative technologies to increase water efficiency.However, the situation is still precarious and it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to help Egypt’s rice farmers overcome the challenges they currently face.",

The plot was foiled by security services, and the five men were arrested and charged with terrorism offenses.The men were found guilty after a trial at Woolwich Crown Court last year, in which security services presented evidence which showed the extent of their involvement in the plot. Prosecutors were able to show how the men had procured weapons, conducted reconnaissance missions, and discussed the potential targets and plans for the attack.In his sentencing statement, the judge, Mr. Justice Sweeney, stated that \"the sentences in this case will be life imprisonment and will be served with no opportunity for parole\". He went on to explain that the plot was a \"very serious offence which involved an extensive amount of planning over a significant period of time\".The sentences received by the five men are a stark reminder of the dangers of extremism, and the consequences of engaging in such dangerous activities.

A debate has been sparked over the rise of illiberal democracies, often referred to as 'managed democracies', across the continent.This debate is centred on the tension between those who support the traditional democratic values of free speech, human rights, and rule of law, and those who wish to pursue a more 'statist' approach to government. Supporters of the latter approach argue that it allows for greater stability and economic prosperity, while opponents claim that it undermines the rule of law and enables governments to act in an increasingly authoritarian manner.The recent surge of populist leaders and governments in countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the United Kingdom has been widely cited as evidence of this shift. In Hungary, the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has come under intense scrutiny for its attempts to dismantle checks and balances and to promote illiberal policies. Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, a series of controversial policies have been introduced by the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which critics fear could lead to a weakening of democratic values.These concerns have been echoed by the European Union, which has warned of the dangers of a 'drift towards authoritarianism' across the continent. To tackle the issue, the European Commission has called for greater respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law, and democracy.The debate over illiberal democracies is likely to remain highly contested in the years ahead.

He was a longtime correspondent for Cadena 3, a local station in Veracruz.The Mexican Association for Freedom of Expression (AMEF) confirmed the journalist’s death, stating: \"Leobardo was the victim of a targeted attack in a region where it is too dangerous to practice journalism.\"Veracruz is one of the most dangerous states in Mexico for journalists, and Vázquez Atzin was the fifth journalist killed in the state in just six months. Most recently, journalist Maximino Rodríguez Palacios was found dead in a ditch in Veracruz in April.Veracruz's governor, Cuitláhuac García Jiménez, said in a statement that his government will not tolerate any attacks on the press and will bring those responsible to justice. Authorities have yet to reveal the identity of the person or persons responsible for Vázquez Atzin’s murder. However, media rights groups believe that he was targeted for his work in the media.The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) released a statement condemning Vázquez Atzin’s murder, and called on authorities to do more to protect journalists in Mexico. They also demanded an independent investigation to identify those responsible for the journalist’s death.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overconsumption of salt is linked to high blood pressure, a leading risk factor for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided guidance to help food processors reduce the amount of sodium in their products. They recommend replacing salt with herbs, spices, and natural flavors, as well as using a variety of salty flavors such as celery, onion, and garlic. They also suggest adding potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride to help reduce the overall amount of salt in processed food. The USDA has urged food manufacturers to set voluntary targets to reduce sodium levels in processed food, and many have already taken steps to do so. The National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) also advocates for a gradual decrease in sodium levels and works to ensure that manufacturers take part in the effort. The NSRI estimates that a 30% reduction in salt in processed food would help millions of people maintain a healthier lifestyle. Reducing salt content in food is an important part of improving public health and protecting consumers. The US government is calling for food processors to join the effort to reduce salt content by a third and help the nation move towards healthier and safer food consumption.",

He studied theology and philosophy at the University of Munich and in 1951 joined the Bavarian clergy. He was ordained a priest in 1951 and his rise in the Catholic Church was swift. In 1981, Pope John Paul II appointed him prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, making him one of the most powerful people in the Church.In 2005, at the age of 78, he was elected pope, becoming the oldest person to assume the papacy in 300 years. He was known for taking a traditional stance on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, which were highly contested during his tenure. In 2013, after eight years of papacy, he became the first pope in modern times to resign from office.Pope Benedict XVI was praised for his strong spiritual leadership and his commitment to the study of theology. He was a prolific writer, having authored three books and a large number of essays and homilies. His writings focused heavily on the connection between faith and reason. He also took a lead role in developing the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a compilation of the Church's teachings. Since his resignation, Benedict XVI has mostly kept a low profile.

Divided into hundreds of small tribal groups, Yemen is a nation of ancient tribal loyalties. Tribal identity can determine loyalties to different factions in the current civil war, with some of Yemen's population allying themselves to the Houthi rebels and others with the government. The presence of tribal forces has led to a more entrenched and violent conflict, as local groups battle for control of certain regions. This tribal system has long been present in Yemen and, in some cases, can be used to maintain a semblance of peace between rival factions. However, as the current conflict intensifies, loyalties between tribes become increasingly important and different political factions can use tribal ties to their own advantage. Consequently, this has caused further violence and disruption across the country.Yemeni leaders have proposed several approaches to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, but for the moment, the tribal system remains an obstacle to any potential peace. By understanding this unique system and its role in the ongoing conflict, international actors can be better placed to help mediate a peaceful solution. For now, the future of Yemen remains uncertain and inextricably tied to its tribal system.",

According to local sources, at least three people were killed and several others were injured in the attack.In a statement released today, the UN team condemned the attack and called on the Chadian government to investigate the incident and hold those responsible to account.

This decision follows a dispute between President Idriss Deby and the CAR president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.The 2,000 Chadian soldiers have been helping to quell a rebel uprising in the CAR since December 2019. The presence of Chad's military was critical for strengthening the CAR government's defence against the rebel forces. Without the Chadian troops, the CAR government's control over rebel-held areas is likely to weaken significantly.The risks for the CAR are not just limited to the rebel forces. The CAR is surrounded by several other countries, who have already expressed concerns about the withdrawal. The United Nations has raised fears of regional instability, while France has warned of a \"military void\" that could allow militants to operate across national borders.The withdrawal has also sparked worry among humanitarian workers in the region. With the security situation deteriorating, aid groups are concerned about the potential for increased violence and the further displacement of vulnerable people.The situation in the CAR is uncertain following Chad's announcement. It remains to be seen how the country will respond to the withdrawal, and how the situation will develop in the coming weeks.",

It can be viewed as a model in some aspects,” said Oh.He added that despite the current political divisions in the country, which have recently resulted in violent clashes between opposing sides, Thailand is still seen as an island of democracy in a region that is increasingly becoming more autocratic.“Thailand should show the way for ASEAN to move forward in terms of developing democracy and respecting fundamental human rights,” he said.Experts have called on Thailand to lead by example in terms of how it responds to the issues in the region, saying it should use its influence to work for peaceful solutions and promote stability and democratic principles.However, the domestic political situation in Thailand could prove to be a roadblock in efforts to create a more democratic future for ASEAN.“If there are sharp political divisions in Thailand, its credibility as a regional leader will be affected,” said Oh.",

Among the newly elected members, only 4% identify as a person of color, a figure that has remained stagnant in recent years. Moreover, the majority of minority representation comes from the United Kingdom, which accounts for 13% of all elected minority members, leaving the rest of the European Union with a total of less than 1%.The lack of minority representation is particularly striking when compared to the demographics of Europe. Studies show that 13.7% of the population in the European Union identify as a person of color, a figure that clearly isn't represented in the European Parliament.Recent attempts to boost the number of minority representatives in European Union institutions have seen little success. Only seven countries have met or exceeded the European Commission's target for non-white candidates in the elections, which recommends that 20% of candidates from a given country should be of a minority background.The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has said that she wants the European Union to become a leader in diversity and inclusion, but so far there has been little to show for it. Advocates for minority rights hope that new initiatives and policies, such as a diverse slate of candidates, will be implemented to ensure that minority voices are better represented in the European Parliament and across all European Union institutions.",

He said that this will also help to protect the physical and mental well-being of election personnel and voters.Nzobonariba claimed that allowing the free press to cover the elections would only create additional disruption and chaos.

But are his claims factually correct? Here’s a look at three of his main statements:First, Trump said that the unemployment rate among African Americans had dropped to the “lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country.” According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official unemployment rate for African Americans was 6.8% in December, the lowest since the government began tracking the data in 1972.Next, Trump claimed that the United States has “created 5.3 million jobs,” since his election in November 2016. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of jobs in the US has grown by 4.9 million since the election.Finally, the president said that the US is currently “enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in over 51 years.” That’s true; the current rate of 4.1% is the lowest since December 1969.Ultimately, while Trump’s claims can be verified, the broader context of his statements is also important. For example, while African American unemployment is currently at its lowest point since 1972, that’s still more than twice the rate of overall unemployment, and African American workers are still paid significantly less than white workers. The same goes for the president’s jobs claim: while employment has grown since 2016, the US economy has been growing steadily since 2009.It’s important to remember that numbers can only tell part of the story. President Trump’s statements in his State of the Union address may be correct in their facts, but they don’t provide the full picture.",

She states that she’s being held “in captivity for refusing to denounce Christ” and that if the government wants her to return home, “they should meet the request of the group”.The recording has sparked outrage in the community, with activists and the government strongly condemning the militants for not releasing Leah with the rest of the schoolgirls.

In recent years, Pennsylvania has seen a shift to a more competitive landscape with Democrats vying to take seats in an historically Republican-dominant district.In the 2018 mid-term elections, seven districts were won by the Democrats, a historic milestone for the party. This has paved the way for Democrats to look to expand their gains in the upcoming elections. With the primaries, Democrats have their sights set on a number of congressional seats, both in the House and Senate.“It is expected that Pennsylvania’s primaries could be a determining factor in the control of the House of Representatives,” said political strategist Sean McCormick. “These elections will determine the political balance of power in the House and will have long-term implications for the future of the nation.”The state’s primaries will be held on April 28th and the results could shape the midterm elections in November. Analysts anticipate that Pennsylvania’s primary elections could be some of the most competitive in the country, setting the tone for the House races in the months to come. This could have a tremendous impact on the House, where Democrats only hold a slim majority. If the trend of Democratic gains continues in Pennsylvania, it could be the tipping point for a full-blown blue wave that could bring the party a stronger majority.While the outcome of the Pennsylvania primaries remains uncertain, one thing is for sure: they will be watched closely by political strategists and analysts around the nation as they could very well determine the future of the House.",

Secular education activists have voiced their worries that the country’s government is attempting to re-impose religious values on the education system, something that has already been attempted in the past.These concerns have been fanned by a number of recent decisions made by the ruling AKP party. This includes the appointment of government-approved imams to sit on education boards, and an alleged move by the government to establish state-funded Islamic schools in Ankara and Istanbul.The government has denied the allegations, claiming that their aim is not to take away secular education in Turkey, but to find a balance between religious and secular values in the education system. This explanation is not satisfying many critics, who point to the AKP’s track record as evidence that these decisions are part of an ongoing move to move Turkey further away from secularism.It has been argued that the move to introduce religious values into the education system runs counter to Turkey’s long history of secular education. Secular activists have argued that the changes are an attack on their beliefs, and that introducing religion into schools is an attempt to control how the population perceives the world.The debate over the government's alleged attack on secular education has become one of the most divisive issues in Turkey in recent years. It has highlighted the stark divide between those who support a secular education system and those who support a more religious one.

This would extend the plan's protections to all federal student loan borrowers. Furthermore, income-driven repayment plans will also be available to those whose student loan debt exceeds their annual incomes. Additionally, a new cap will limit the amount of money borrowers must pay each month to 10 percent of their monthly discretionary income, and any remaining debt after 20 or 25 years of repayment, depending on the loan program, will be forgiven.In a statement, Obama said that “It’s time we stopped punishing young people for doing the right thing and start rewarding those who take responsibility for their education.

The Prime Minister responded by saying that Bulgaria supports a \"manageable and regulated\" process of immigration.

The Pope had earlier visited refugee camps and met with several migrants, including unaccompanied minors.

The Pope's trip to Bulgaria was part of a three-day visit to the Balkans and came amid rising tensions between the EU and Bulgaria over migration policy. Bulgaria has become an increasingly tough critic of migration, as the country struggles to cope with the influx of thousands of migrants from the Middle East and Africa in recent years. The Pope's visit is seen as an attempt to bridge the divide between Bulgaria and the EU on the issue of migration.

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.

Police wanted the demonstrators to move to their original protest grounds, Dewey Square, where the protesters have set up a tent city.Police had warned that protesters who did not obey police orders would be arrested on charges of unlawful assembly and trespassing.Many of the protesters arrested Tuesday are affiliated with the Occupy Boston group, which is an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York last month.Occupy Wall Street is a loosely organized, grass-roots movement that has held protests and sit-ins in various American cities. Demonstrators protest a variety of issues, including corporate greed and economic inequality.

The 17-track CD is titled Lucky Dube ? The Best Of. It features all the hits that made the South African musician a household name across the continent, and abroad. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately.

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government.

Most students have left the area for safer places in the country’s interior.Cameroon education officials say violent raids and kidnappings by the Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram are taking their toll.Monouna Fotso with the Ministry of Secondary Education said regular cross-border attacks have virtually halted academic activity along Cameroon’s 500 kilometer boundary with Nigeria's Borno state, the stronghold of the militant group. Schools are a favorite target of Boko Haram, whose name means Western education is sin.\"The diagnosis is going on if there are some which are destroyed or occupied because some of the schools were temporarily occupied. I am telling you we are preoccupied, very preoccupied by this situation. It is the whole government, it is not only the Ministry of Secondary Education, that is preoccupied,\" said Fotso.Fotso said due to the insecurity, authorities have advised students and teachers to relocate.\"If there are some localities where the situation is so bad, at the level of the government, we will relocate some schools. At that moment also, we will bring the staff and students to new sites. The objective of this Boko Haram is to traumatize our citizens,\" Fotso said.The border areas which have been hardest hit are Amchide, Fotocol, Kolofata and Kiti Matari.",

And, there have been cases of contractor abuse ranging from violence to cultural insensitivity that have given the private security industry a bad name among many Afghans.Karzai set this month as the deadline for private security firms to be replaced with the interior ministry's new Afghan Private Protection Force or APPF. That deadline has been extended for up to 90 days to facilitate the transition. But more than 50 private security companies will be dissolved and more than 10,000 security guards will be re-assigned or replaced.Brigadier General Carsten Jacobson, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, says this is an important milestone in the process of transferring all security responsibilities to Afghan forces before most international combats troops withdraw in 2014. ?The APPF is focusing now on taking over security responsibility for development projects, convoys and commercial businesses,\" said Jacobson. \"By March 2013 all security for ISAF bases and construction sites are scheduled to transition to the APPF.?Of course the service is not free.

Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality.

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

The winner becomes prime minister due to the LDP-led coalition's grip on parliament.\"It is my responsibility to respond to the mandate of the people,\" Abe told reporters during a trip to southwestern Japan.\"I am resolved to steer Japan for another three years as LDP president and prime minister.\"Analysts say Abe looks set hold on to the top job because his nearly six years in power have enabled him to woo LDP backers with cabinet posts and other favors and to shut out rivals, while a weak opposition makes his lukewarm popularity among the electorate less relevant.Abe began a second stint as prime minister in 2012 promising to reboot the deflation-plagued economy with his \"Abenomics\" policies and to bolster defense.He has boosted defense spending and loosened constitutional limits on the military but, on the economic side, the Bank of Japan has failed to reach its 2 percent inflation target despite an ultra-loose policy.What Abe will pursue if he wins the vote and extends his tenure as prime minister is far from clear.\"What is the economic agenda?",

The vast majority of the outgoing European Parliament, which votes on EU laws and has a say in the bloc's policies, is also white. The new assembly, serving from 2019-24, will be only slightly more diverse.The number of black women in the assembly is expected to increase to six from just one in the last mandate, Chander said.Representation of Europe's biggest minority, the Roma, has dropped, however. Only three Roma members were elected last month while five served in the last mandate.",

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources.

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers. “It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle,” said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.A pro-Russian man (not seen) holds a Russian flag behind an armed servicemen on top of a Russian army vehicle outside a Ukrainian border guard post in the Crimean town of Balaclava, March 1, 2014.Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich. But for the authorities in Kiev and local politicians still loyal to Ukraine, the rapid pace of events were evidence of a carefully orchestrated campaign from Moscow. Moscow denies any role in installing Aksyonov, who is known from his business days by the nickname “The Goblin”. But even those close to the Kremlin say Russia picked him. “Moscow always bet on Yanukovich. But after the coup in Kiev on Feb. 22 ...

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country.
