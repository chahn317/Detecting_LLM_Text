The new limits in the western Pacific, which make up 60 percent of the worldwide bluefin tuna catch, are expected to protect about one-third of the bluefin tuna population in the region. Last year, fishermen caught nearly 14,000 metric tons of Pacific bluefin tuna, about two-thirds of the worldwide catch.A conservation group said the quotas, which were based on the findings of a scientific survey, will help save the bluefin tuna from extinction.\"This is really a watershed event,\" said David Pimentel, the chairman of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. \"The bluefin tuna is one of the most imperiled species on the planet, and this is an important first step.\"The bluefin tuna is considered one of the most beautiful of fish and is prized for its meat and caviar, which fetches as much as $100 a teaspoon. But there has been growing alarm in recent years about the species, which is nearly extinct in the eastern Pacific Ocean.",

On Thursday he called for the legalization of marijuana at the federal level, expunging past marijuana use convictions and using revenue from sales to repair some of the damage done by the decades-long “war on drugs”.“We have to talk honestly about the War on Drugs that has just been an epic, epic failure, that has unfairly targeted too many African-Americans and Latinos,” Booker said.U.S. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR“Democrats want to see change, we cannot just keep putting a Band-Aid on this broken system. We have a president that is doing everything he can to rip those Band-Aids off,” Klobuchar, 59, said.“I do not think we should decriminalize everything,” she added, saying drug use and abuse should be treated as a health crisis.PETE BUTTIGIEGAsked about former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent move to rescind guidelines that protected legalized marijuana, Buttigieg, 37, said: “We have seen lives being ruined because of petty marijuana possession.”“Marijuana is a drug.

And, by the way, Obamacare has been repealed in this bill. …The Republican tax cut is projected to add at least $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that it would increase the deficit by $1.76 trillion over 10 years.)In his speech Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Trump said: \"We will never abolish our heroes, we will never abandon our values and we will never allow a small group of criminals and illegal agents to threaten our safety.\"The phrase \"small group of criminals and illegal agents\" is a reference to MS-13, a brutal street gang that originated in Los Angeles and now has thousands of members across the country.The president has repeatedly exaggerated the role of MS-13 in the recent killing of two Virginia high school students, one of them a Muslim whose family fled to the U.S. from Syria. Federal prosecutors are seeking to death penalty the man charged in their killings, an MS-13 member who was in the country illegally.TRUMP: \"We've saved the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price\" of drugs for other countries.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says Trump is referencing a January article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which Azar said found a 25 percent reduction in the average wholesale price of six of the world's most commonly used drugs. That equates to tens of billions of dollars in potential savings.The article's lead author, Dr. Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool in England, tells The Associated Press it's impossible to know how much of the drug price drop is directly attributable to the administration's actions. It mostly stems from the fact that the prices were inflated to begin with, he said.TRUMP: \"The unemployment rate for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.\"",

It has also put off a plan to start issuing bonds for the first time.The delay is a major setback for Dubai, which has been counting on such deals to fund a series of ambitious construction projects, including the $1 billion expansion of a theme park and an expected increase in the number of people living in the city from 1.5 million to 2.2 million in the next seven years.But Dubai has said it has cash on hand to meet its existing commitments, and it has so far avoided the need to ask its main creditors for a bailout.Still, as it faces a sharp downturn in its economy, Dubai will have to contend with rising labor costs and a growing budget deficit.The city, which was once a playground for millionaires from the U.S. and Europe, has attracted tens of thousands of construction workers from Asia and the Middle East and now has more than 800,000 residents. It has been able to expand its population through the building boom, but is now facing high inflation and a jump in its unemployment rate, which increased to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2009 from 8% at the same time last year.The city’s economy expanded by an average of 7.6% a year during the last decade, but most of the growth came from construction and real-estate activities.The city, which gets most of its revenue from the rent of its vast portfolio of commercial and residential real estate, saw its real-estate prices plunge by as much as 50% in the last year, according to a report by the Dubai Statistics Center.Property developers, who sold many of their units well before the building boom turned to bust, are facing sharp losses.“",

Another 15 people were killed in various Taliban attacks across the country on Friday, including a bombing in the capital, Kabul, that targeted the country’s chief of intelligence.In northern Kunduz province, where the Taliban control many of the remote districts, the insurgents attacked Khan Abad district from several directions on Thursday and fighting is still ongoing, according to Mohammad Yusouf Ayubi, the head of the provincial council. Ayubi said the Taliban have seized several villages but the Afghan security forces are fighting back.The fighting has left 37 civilians dead and around 80 wounded, Ayubi said.The Interior Ministry confirmed the deaths of the police officers on Friday but did not say how many had died in the bus attack. The ministry also confirmed that the Taliban attacked security posts in the districts of Imam Sahib, Sayad and Sherzad.The relentless Taliban attacks underscore the struggles that Afghan security forces have faced since the United States and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. They have continued to fight the Taliban who have seized several districts across the country. The U.S. has meanwhile ramped up attacks, carrying out more airstrikes this year than in the last decade.Afghanistan is also struggling with an Islamic State affiliate that has expanded its footprint in the country, carrying out horrific attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians. The extremists also aim to overthrow the Western-backed government.The Taliban have refused to sign on to a peace deal with the Afghan government, despite repeated overtures from the U.S., saying a permanent cease-fire would only be part of the negotiations.The Taliban have also continued to attack the country’s largest prison on the outskirts of the capital. The insurgents have released hundreds of prisoners in the past two weeks and the battle has left parts of the prison in rubble.",

William Russell, adding that the Air Force determined that it no longer provided “sufficient capability” to meet mission requirements.Russell told The Associated Press that there was little risk of the remains of USA 193 hitting any one particular spot.“It re-entered well above any population, land or sea,” Russell said in an email, noting it was the 65th such demolition since 1991.The satellite was decommissioned in 2008 after more than 19 years in orbit, but was kept in an orbit too low for its decaying orbit to take it out of the atmosphere, which takes a few weeks. It was dragged down Wednesday into a long, planned disintegration over the Pacific.The Air Force determined the satellite was non-functional and that there were no plans to recover the remains, Russell said.Last year the US military, under former President Donald Trump, was preparing to destroy a different type of satellite in order to avoid the risk that it could collide with a functional spacecraft. The mission was canceled at the last minute to examine whether the non-functional satellite's remains could provide additional insight into what happened.The US has been creating new space teams to better protect and defend its interests in orbit, and this week announced that Trump had appointed Gen. John Raymond to lead US Space Command.The military has also established a new Space Force, but that branch is not yet in charge of in-orbit operations.",

Now the government is pursuing a controversial 6,000-megawatt dam that it says is a cornerstone of development and crucial to its water security.The dam is the largest ever built by Egypt, and one of the world’s largest, and construction began in 2015 despite fierce criticism from rights groups who feared it could disrupt the river’s flow and threaten the livelihood of tens of millions of Egyptians.Egyptians were initially encouraged to see their country was building a hydroelectric dam after years of drought had led to water rationing.But as work nears completion ahead of a 2022 deadline, the impact on rice farmers, and on irrigation and fishing communities, is coming into focus.‘Invisible’ damageFarmer Mahmoud Ali says the impact of dam construction on his delta land in Kafr al-Sheikh, northeast of the capital, Cairo, is clear.“The water level of the Nile has dropped so much. Before the dam there was enough water for farming for two to three months, now it is only one month,” said Ali, who like many in the area makes a living growing rice, wheat, sugar cane and watermelon.The dam is close to being operational but will not be fully completed for another few years.“There is damage that is so visible and so huge, but I don’t think there has been any kind of impact assessment,” said Ibrahim Sultan, a researcher who has studied the project.Farmer Ali fears that within a few years his livelihood will be destroyed.“",

The current prototype can be assembled from commercially available parts for just a few thousand euros.An Italian-developed robotic hand can pick up a bottle or a small child, and could be used in prosthetics, factory automation, search and rescue and more.The hand was developed by a team of researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, a branch of IIT, the Italian Institute of Technology, a top engineering school. The hand has five joints and weighs between 100 and 150 grams. A prototype was presented Wednesday at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Stockholm, Sweden. [7 Robots that Will Take Over Your Job]While the researchers' ultimate goal is to create a robotic hand that can replace a human hand, the current model is too heavy and bulky for such a purpose, the researchers said. So their first order of business is to use it in prosthetics.\"In the next months, we will demonstrate that a robot hand, made from lightweight, inexpensive materials, that can be easily put on and taken off, can grasp an object, and that it can perform basic manipulations,\" the researchers said in a statement.The hand uses two small servomotors, or devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical force, which can be attached to a patient's arm so it can move when the patient uses their muscles to control the robotic hand. The hand has a lightweight pneumatic artificial muscle that can be inflated to expand or deflate to make the hand open or close.While human muscles can move more than 100 times per second, the robotic hand can only move 10 times per second, so patients will need to train the hand for about two months before they can use it effectively, the researchers said.Currently, the hand is controlled through a computer and must be kept within 1.8 meters (6 feet, 2 inches) of the computer, although the researchers are working on a way to make the hand work without a computer. The current version is about 15 inches long (40 centimeters).The robotic hand was created by combining different technologies in different ways.",

Inside the camp’s large kitchen, people stand at tables, cutting up chicken and vegetables.The children are mostly Syrians, but some Iraqis and Afghans are also living here.This is a temporary camp. But more Syrians are moving into this camp now because the number of displaced people inside the country is growing.The United Nations refugee agency reported on Friday that at least 1 million Syrians have now fled to neighboring countries.“There are a few reasons why people choose to live in a camp or even a tent,” the U.N. refugee agency spokesman in Turkey, Firat Ahmetoglu, told VOA.“One is the security situation, especially in the border area. We have a lot of displaced people in these camps in close vicinity to the border. Then, there is the cost factor. When we have a very large number of displaced people who are living in close vicinity of the border, they would have no choice but to be living in a camp,” he said.There are tens of thousands of people living in Turkey’s camps. But U.N. officials say there is no easy solution for these people.“What I want you to know is that there are no easy solutions here because the problems we are facing are long-term,” Ahmetoglu said.A Syrian child sits at the entrance of a camp for refugees in the eastern town of Tunceli, Turkey, July 28, 2011.Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million of the 2.5 million displaced Syrians in camps on Syrian soil.

The clerics have helped promote a series of laws introduced by successive Bangladeshi governments that activists say threaten religious freedom and allow conservative religious leaders to silence their critics.In recent years, these laws have helped spur an anti-Western, anti-Israel, pro-Islamist movement that has led to attacks on liberal writers and an ongoing, bloody insurgency in the Muslim-majority state of South Asia.It has been years since Bangladesh’s founding father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, declared that “this country has no religion,” when the country was officially declared secular.But even as its people become more religiously conservative, the country’s laws remain deeply secular. Last year, a Bangladeshi blogger was sentenced to life in prison for criticizing Islam and religious extremism online.The rise of Islamists has coincided with the crackdown by the government and security forces on Islamic groups that have sought to install Islamic sharia, or Islamic law, since independence from Pakistan in 1971.“",

The salt reduction plan is an outgrowth of President Obama’s executive order on nutrition and physical activity, which was issued last month.The president’s order directs the Agriculture Department to cut sodium in food served by federal nutrition programs.

The Vatican also released the pope's full schedule for the Greek portion of his trip.The pope will land in Athens on Saturday morning, where he will pay his respects to a series of martyrs buried there.

The five districts represent a mix of urban, suburban and rural areas, and they cover a wide swath of the state.For Democrats, the key will be whether liberal voters show up to support candidates who embrace the progressive agenda or stick with more centrist nominees. Many of the districts, especially in western Pennsylvania, draw from a blue-collar coalition that has traditionally voted for union-backed Democrats but has drifted to Trump and the GOP.That’s what Lamb faced in the 18th District. He ran as a centrist Democrat and won a three-way race in March, even though Republican Rick Saccone also embraced Trump’s agenda and ran on anti-union messages.Lamb’s moderate profile and his success in the district, which Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points, has many Democratic political activists in the state asking if that formula could be repeated in the upcoming primaries.“It’s not about left or right in this race,” said Bill DeWeese, the chair of the Greene County Democrats. “It’s about right and wrong.”Democrats are also trying to defeat Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in the 12th District, where they believe organized labor’s deep pockets will give the party’s nominee a chance to knock off one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country.There, the favored Democratic candidate, union lawyer Mary Gay Scanlon, is facing off against John Morganelli, a former county official who has campaigned alongside the president.

We have to draw on past reserves to fund the shortfall,\" he added.Singapore's economy depends heavily on international trade and tourism, sectors that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\"It will not be easy, but we can take courage and confidence from the fact that we have done it before, and we can do it again,\" said Lee, 68, who is also the finance minister.A record 11.3% GDP growth in 2010 was fueled by a property boom. The country was badly hit during the global financial crisis in 2009.The government expects gross domestic product to fall 4% to 7% this year, marking the biggest contraction in gross domestic product since independence, according to Reuters calculations. The economy grew 2.2% last year.The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it will allow banks to distribute their reserves in a bid to boost lending.\"We have to prepare for a difficult journey ahead,\" said Prime Minister Lee.The budget deficit is expected to swell to an unprecedented S$44.3 billion or 11.2% of GDP.A recession in Singapore could be more painful than during the 2008 financial crisis, central bank chief Ravi Menon said on Thursday.",

Defendants have legal and factual objections to these subpoenas and have not consented to their issuance,\" Trump's suit said.\"The subpoenas violate the Constitution, the separation of powers, and every past precedent,\" it continued. \"They emanate from the House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Financial Services and Intelligence. Plaintiffs have requested this Court adjudicate these serious constitutional and legislative issues because Plaintiffs have a profound interest in defending the scope of the separation of powers and a strong and free Nation.\"This is the first of two expected lawsuits against Democratic-led congressional panels from the president's legal team.\"President Trump brought these actions to protect the office of the President, the First Family, and the United States of America from further political intimidation and abuse,\" said Jay Sekulow, counsel for the President, in a statement. \"The subpoenas issued by the House Committees lack any legitimate legislative purpose, are designed to induce law enforcement to conduct impermissible investigations, and threaten the President's ability to effectively govern the Nation.\"\"If left undisturbed,\" Sekulow continued, \"these subpoenas would set a dangerous precedent in that they subject private and business finances to intrusive subpoenas, and threaten to interfere dramatically with the President's relationship with foreign leaders.\"",

United States and United States v. Knotts.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion that the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches requires probable cause and a warrant when police use historical cellphone location information to track criminal suspects.In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that requiring probable cause or a warrant is consistent with the Constitution's Framers' intent, noting, \"It is not our role to create policy.\"Privacy advocates cheered the ruling. But law enforcement warned that the decision would have ramifications for investigations of terrorism and child abductions.In a statement, the U.S. Department of Justice said the decision will create new privacy protections for suspected criminals, though it also said the opinion could \"disrupt the investigative efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement.\"Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, noted that some types of location information \"are so inherently revealing\" that they require a warrant.\"A cellphone's detailed records can provide a window into a person's life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his associations and intimate associations as well,\" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \"These details can identify not only the location of a cellphone but also where that phone has been throughout the day and whom the phone user has met. The record here proves that an individual carrying a cellphone can be tracked over lengthy periods of time.\"",

It is the single largest humanitarian program in the region and also benefits many refugees in neighboring Arab countries.Agency spokesman Chris Gunness says funding from donor governments is “falling short of meeting needs, as has been the case in the past” and the agency has been forced to delay salary payments and to cut the food assistance it provides to more than a million refugees who are dependant on it.Gunness says the agency’s operations are threatened, not only by financial shortfalls but also by a “lack of support” by governments which can have a “catastrophic” impact on Palestinian refugees in general.The agency’s “Desperate Appeal” for funds follows warnings by its director, Pierre Krahenbuhl, that it is at risk of becoming insolvent in 2018 and would have to suspend programs unless funding was quickly found.The agency provides assistance to Palestinian refugees, both in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. UNRWA has already reduced its operations in Gaza and Syria and says it must consider doing the same in Lebanon.UNRWA Commissioner General Pierre Krahenbuhl warned in early May that the agency would need to lay off more than half of its workforce, including up to 70 percent of staff in its Gaza Strip operations, unless funding was quickly found.Krahenbuhl has said that the “chronic underfunding” faced by UNRWA has been exacerbated by a loss of $300 million over the last two years.UNRWA was created in December 1949 after the 1948 war that followed Israel’s establishment to support 700,000 Palestinian refugees who became displaced. Today, the agency says that number has grown to about 6 million.",

Yoo had the most formal trade experience, having previously served as South Korea's ambassador to the United States and the United Nations and in a series of trade positions in the South Korean government.Yoo was also seen as the leading reformer of the organization; some experts saw him as more willing to overhaul the rules-based institution than Lamy.

Two of those being sought by Interpol are in Israel, and two are in Turkey, with the agency offering up $20,000 for each of the wanted men, the Israel police said.The murder of Jabari, one of the Hamas terror group’s top military leaders, led to the Israel-Hamas war in 2014. The Red Notice does not represent a guilty verdict on the part of Interpol, but only the police organization’s interest in the wanted men. In a statement on its website, Interpol said the men were wanted for “murder and attempted murder, as well as belonging to a terrorist organization.”Hamas, for its part, said that the Red Notice represented “a major achievement for the Palestinian people. It represents a clear verdict of Israel and the international community that these terrorists committed a crime against the Palestinian people, against the Hamas leadership, and against the Palestinian political system.

I agree,” said Secretary-General Ban. “But what worries me is the gap between that belief and the actions required to address the world’s most urgent challenges.”Mr. Ban noted that although world leaders had recently committed themselves to halving global poverty and eradicating extreme hunger by 2015 and 2020, as called for in the Millennium Development Goals, much more needed to be done to ensure that the 1.5 billion people still without health insurance received treatment and that 100 million more children survived.In his speech, Mr. Ban also noted that achieving these goals would not be possible without progress towards universal health coverage (UHC).“In low- and middle-income countries, the vast majority of people live without access to essential medical care – and many more live with fear that illness might bankrupt their families,” he said. “These realities demand rapid and coordinated action.”“I believe that we must focus the world’s attention on providing affordable and essential care to all in a timely manner,” he said. “That requires us to expand and strengthen our primary health systems to reach those most vulnerable.”The Secretary-General announced that a follow-up high-level meeting in 2011 will launch a UHC action plan.“This must be our objective: universal coverage by 2015, in accordance with the International Health Regulations,” he said.",

While China dismissed it as a \"provocation,\" analysts believe it signaled deeper U.S. ties to the island, home to about 24 million people, but considered by Beijing to be part of the mainland. \"We believe that these kinds of actions will help to prevent China from taking further unilateral actions to undermine the cross-strait status quo,\" said Air Force Capt.

In April, the U.S. State Department approved $8 billion worth of arms sales to Taiwan—a package that includes M1A2T Abrams tanks, Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile defense systems and Stinger missiles. Earlier this month, two senior U.S. State Department officials visited Taiwan to attend a regional security forum. But analysts in China say Taiwan is testing the patience of Beijing. Speaking to CCTV, a Chinese broadcaster, Song Zhongping, a military expert, said Taiwan was \"playing with fire\" and the \"Chinese mainland will have to respond,\" suggesting a more forceful response might be considered.",

During the attack, some of the victims, including the suspect, were streaming the live video of the event live on Facebook and Twitter.” So begins “Using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to Follow the Boston Bombing,” a post on the Internet Journalism Review website that details the ways social media was used to follow the bombing.As horrific events become more commonplace due to an increasingly connected world, social media becomes a more integral part of coverage and response. However, the way people use social media can either be a force for good, helping to unite people in crisis and tragedy, or a divisive and hurtful tool used to spread hate and prejudice.In times of crisis, Twitter and Facebook can help to spread news about what’s happening in real time by using Twitter hashtags such as #bostonmarathon or #prayforboston. But when people feel they have a certain cause, the tools that connect them via social media can be used for their own benefit and the detriment of others.“As a reporter I think it is great. But the same tools have the potential to be misused,” says John Ferrugia, a former news editor and writer at TIME Magazine. “This was a perfect example of how social media can be used in a very positive way. And when a terrorist’s name is mentioned you’re only able to learn more from it when you’re able to access it live. That’s what we saw in Boston and what you might call a modern-day lynch mob could not have happened without the accessibility of social media.”In the aftermath of a tragedy, social media provides an opportunity to discuss and help those affected. For example, the hashtag #prayforparis is encouraging users to share their photos, videos, music and prayer requests using the image above to show support and solidarity with the people of France. “I had to start praying for the city of #paris,” one user said.",

The situation is exacerbated because of a lack of services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes.Shelter, legal aid, medical care and counseling are often hard to come by in tribal communities.The federal Indian Health Service (IHS), which serves 3.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, has a network of 250 health care facilities, but advocates say it's inadequate.\"If you go to these facilities you'll find long lines, there are people who cannot get an appointment, there's not enough doctors,\" says Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians.The IHS reported earlier this year that American Indian women are 11 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the general population, and that more than one in four American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime.The IHS says it plans to add services on reservation lands, but says some tribes are in no position to take over programs.\"We've got to find a balance between giving them some services and at the same time recognizing tribal sovereignty,\" says IHS Chief Medical Officer Michael Toedt.In addition, funding from the IHS is less generous than the federal justice system for sexual assault cases.\"The government is paying the tribes to handle most of these cases and it's not enough, so they're forced to turn victims away,\" says Andrews-Maltais.The National Congress of American Indians says American Indian and Alaska Native women are often afraid to seek services because the IHS has a record of ignoring or dismissing women's claims.\"They don't want to go to the IHS,\" says Andrews-Maltais.Other programs such as housing, job training and counseling are also badly needed.

They are also expected to ask about the report’s criticism of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The Justice Department says that before the hearing, Barr will face the House Judiciary Committee.__12:09 a.m.President Donald Trump is seeking to discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller as Barr defends his handling of Mueller’s Russia report.The president is tweeting: “Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt. Result of the Mueller Report, NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!”Mueller found no evidence Trump colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential campaign but reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice.Barr, who is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump did not obstruct justice. That statement drew sharp criticism from Democrats, especially Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham.Barr says Mueller didn’t engage in good faith with Barr’s initial four-page letter summarizing the main findings of the report.",

This new video provides an update on the situation. This movement is growing and has the potential to make a difference. It’s time for each and every one of us to get involved and do something.The Occupy Wall Street movement has garnered lots of media coverage. Even though a small number of protestors gathered in Liberty Square last weekend, the message and the movement have grown exponentially since September.Now, a group of occupiers in Zuccotti Park is seeking to re-establish a physical presence at the park. For those who don’t know the backstory, the park was shut down and cleaned out by NYC officials on the morning of October 1st, as protesters were celebrating two months of occupation in the area. But this movement is far from over.This video was posted on YouTube by a group called Occupy Wall Street General Assembly. According to Occupy Wall Street’s official website, the group is “a horizontal network of individuals organizing nonviolently to address the many structural problems caused by the concentrated wealth of the 1% in our society.”Here’s an overview of the movement:On September 17th we launched a sit in at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan’s Financial District. We are the people you want running the country. We have doctors, teachers, students, lawyers, artists, workers, and people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. We have created a community in the middle of the street that none of us can leave. We are the 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%. We are organizing to take the power back from those who’ve stolen it, and to create a society that works for all of us.Overwhelmingly, people are joining us.",

This is an organized attempt to discredit Fudan Marxist students,” the newspaper asserted.In response to these “illegal and criminal activities,” Fudan’s police have launched an investigation into Wang and will also take action against “those students supporting Wang in his illegal activities,” the report claimed. “According to our laws and regulations, we will take an objective and fair stance on all the cases related to student activities in accordance with law,” Fudan University said in a statement cited by the newspaper.China routinely arrests its citizens over the use of illegal speech online, such as using a phone app to post a joke, and often forces those arrested to pay a fine rather than serve time in prison. China also employs internet censorship to block content from Chinese citizens, which often includes information that reflects poorly on the Chinese Communist Party.The People’s Daily did not elaborate on the exact legal violations that Wang allegedly committed. The legal system in China, however, places many restrictions on Communist Party critics and criminalizes speech the party does not approve of.",

She said he forced her to have sex with other men and raped her repeatedly. When she tried to escape, he threatened to kill her.After the verdict, she was so nervous that she struggled to sit down. She smiled and waved to reporters as she was escorted away.The Associated Press doesn't usually identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they have spoken publicly, but the woman requested anonymity.The judge must now decide what amount of compensation to award her. She had originally been given AUD$450,000 ($341,000) by the government, but took the case to court to try and get more. The Australian government will pay any amount the judge decides.In his ruling, Justice John Logan said there was a \"substantial\" chance the man, identified in the ruling by the pseudonym Thomas Joseph Sweeney, had indeed threatened to kill the woman if she didn't have sex with his associates and that she would not have come to Australia if she wasn't given false promises.The judge said the woman was a \"good witness\" whose evidence was consistent over time.\"It is very unlikely that a person would make up such a story,\" Logan said.The woman's lawyer, George Vlahakis, said the case could pave the way for better outcomes for human-trafficking victims who find it difficult to prove that they were coerced into sexual activities.\"",

David, first thing to tell us, why are we hearing from North Korea today?DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Well, these are the regular, routine threats that come from North Korea to coincide with the start of every winter. But there's also a political dimension to this. Today's statement came from the general in charge of the North Korean army. He was apparently responding to an earlier statement by the Pentagon that said the North Korean threat against South Korea and its allies will be met with an overwhelming response.And on the domestic front here in North Korea, there are reports of a purge of a number of high-ranking officials, at least according to a South Korean official.CONAN: A purge, meaning what?WELNA: Well, it's not clear yet if that means, you know, the execution of a large number of people - or not.

President Paul Kagame, an African Union leader, has faced criticism from the United States for suppressing dissent and cracking down on opposition politicians.“If they say to Africans that they should follow this model that has made them successful, it is very dangerous,” Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said.Lugar asked Zogby whether it would be better to have a dictatorial Rwandan government, or a corrupt, autocratic one that would be easier to change.“There’s a difference between an authoritarian who believes that government has an obligation to serve its people, or an authoritarian who believes that government has an obligation to rule its people,” Zogby said.Kagame is credited with pushing for social justice in Rwanda through the elimination of inequality, poverty and economic imbalances. He has also used economic development to justify strong political control, which has been effective, but has also fueled concerns about abuse of power.The president won a third seven-year term by a landslide in 2003 and will now likely face only token opposition.“We need to find out what is the motivation of Paul Kagame,” Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) said.The Rwandan government has defended its rights record and denounced attacks on the government as unfair.“We have a very active and vocal political opposition,” said Rwandan Ambassador to the U.S.",

To see the article click hereThe World Health Organisation has introduced a new article on compassion fatigue to its website. This is the first in a series of articles based on the original document, the others on burnout.The article gives a very useful definition of compassion fatigue,‘Compassion fatigue is a psychological reaction (similar to burnout) that can develop as a result of repeated exposure to trauma, stress or tragedy. It can be triggered by working in healthcare, humanitarian assistance or development sectors, where exposure to death, sickness and suffering can be intense and regular.It is a normal human reaction that may result in some form of psychological distress. Compassion fatigue can develop when you experience repeated traumatic stress on a regular basis, as a professional who is working in crisis situations, or as an aid worker.It may also happen when you are a witness to or survivor of trauma and are required to regularly reflect on the traumatic incident and its implications. It can happen when you are exposed to repeated or ongoing trauma.While it is normal to experience strong emotions in the face of trauma, for example anger, grief and sadness, compassion fatigue can lead to prolonged distress and loss of joy in your work.’The first part of the article outlines what compassion fatigue is and how it can happen. The second part gives some strategies for coping.It is refreshing to read this article because it is clear, concise and offers practical advice. It is also quite accurate with the exception of its references to health care workers.Health care workers do not get compassion fatigue, they get burnout.",

        "text": "Europe's latest parliament is on course for the most diverse representation in history. But political change needs to go far beyond the doors of the parliament itself.Von SPIEGEL StaffIn the aftermath of the European elections in May, observers spoke not just of historic change for the European Union, but also a historic breakthrough in diversity.The parties in the next parliament will be the most diverse in the history of the parliament itself, they noted. Women will hold a majority of seats for the first time -- 56 percent of the total 751 seats, according to estimates by the Center for European Reform (CER). This will make the European Parliament look more like the rest of the EU than ever before.But when the parliament sits in Strasbourg to begin its first session on July 2, it will still reflect the continent's diversity only at a surface level. Of the 28 commissioners who will run EU affairs in Brussels and Strasbourg from the start of next year, only seven are women.Nor will a large majority of those attending be people of color. More than half of the incoming parliament is white; about a quarter is from Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Just one member, from the Green Party, will be from a former Eastern bloc country, Hungary. Only one Muslim woman, from Cyprus, will be in the new parliament. The parliament will include only three members of the Romani community.While the political world is changing to be more open and diverse, the makeup of the parliament itself shows that change has been limited and patchy.New Faces, Old ProblemsOn June 28, the day after the new parliament was formed, some 50 European parliamentarians gathered in the parliament building in Strasbourg for a discussion. Their task was to discuss the role of minorities.At the outset, some politicians argued that in itself the increased diversity would prove sufficient to improve the situation of minorities. \"The parliament will look like the continent,\" insisted the Dutch member of parliament Roelof van der Staaij.But most of those present were not convinced. Minorities have long been marginalized in Europe, said Sijbren de Jong, leader of the Dutch GreenLeft Party, and it is time to put that right.The members of parliament had gathered as part of a project run by a Danish journalist and his Dutch researcher, Maarten Hulshof.",

Supporters of President Trump gathered to protest the result, which was announced a few days earlier and had not been questioned by the courts. Still, the inauguration went off peacefully, with the transfer of power from one administration to another completed.There are three sets of people involved in a presidential inauguration: the elected officials, the invited guests and the public. The president and vice-president swear to uphold the Constitution and be president and vice-president of the United States, respectively. They are escorted to the front of the Capitol, where they stand on the dais with their hands on a Bible or the Quran (the vice-president has the option of using a Bible, if that is preferred). The elected officials are sworn in by the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, or someone appointed by him. The elected president swears by the Bible or the Quran that they \"will faithfully execute the office of president.\"The president then gives a brief speech, during which the vice-president and the elected officials repeat their oaths. This is followed by the president delivering a \"mandate speech,\" which is a written description of the policy agenda they plan to follow and the priorities they have set for their term of office. This speech is also given to the public on television. Then the new president delivers their inaugural address, in which they set forth their vision for the country and the path they will follow to accomplish that vision.All of these speeches, from the president's mandate speech through the inaugural address, are delivered in the House Chamber, which has been restored to its original state after its renovation in the early 1900s.The inauguration is a solemn moment in U.S. history and there are many traditions, many dating back hundreds of years, designed to create an atmosphere of peace and unity and to show that the United States is a nation of laws. The new president takes the oath of office on the Bible or the Quran and they and their family members observe a moment of silence to remember the past and honor the sacrifices that have been made for their country.",

We are going to get this done by the end of this year,\" Ryan, the highest ranking Republican in Congress, said at a news conference on Capitol Hill with other Republican leaders.House Republicans have passed a plan to slash taxes on corporations and individuals through a process called budget reconciliation, but the Senate's rules require the legislation to have a 51-vote super-majority to pass the Senate.The reconciliation process allows Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority but allows only tax cuts and cannot include major changes to social services.Ryan said his party has the votes needed to pass a tax reform bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 52-48 edge, with two seats up for grabs in early January 2018. The Senate will be under Republican control for the next two years, since the November election produced a 50-50 tie and the Republican majority in the upper chamber cannot be reduced below 51 votes until late 2019.But as a number of Republican senators are on record opposing the budget reconciliation process, the party's margin is limited.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his party will also need to pass a spending bill in December to fund the government.\"If we get both of those done, which I think we will, that's probably going to be the year-end deadline,\" McConnell said.Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will begin taking up the defense portion of the budget in January.The U.S. defense budget accounts for about three-quarters of discretionary spending in the U.S. government.",

His order applies to two projects, scheduled to begin as early as Saturday, to replace 51 miles (82 kilometers) of fence in two areas on the Mexican border.Gilliam issued the ruling after hearing arguments last week in two cases. California and 19 other states brought one lawsuit; the Sierra Club and a coalition of communities along the border brought the other. His ruling was the first of several lawsuits against Trump’s controversial decision to bypass the normal appropriations process to pay for his long-sought wall.“The position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds ‘without Congress’ does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,” the judge wrote in granting a temporary injunction to stop construction.At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make progress in a signature campaign promise heading into his campaign for a second term.Trump declared a national emergency in February after losing a fight with the Democratic-led House over fully paying for the wall that led to a 35-day government shutdown. As a compromise on border and immigration enforcement, Congress set aside $1.375 billion to extend or replace existing barriers in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.Trump grudgingly accepted the money, but then declared the national emergency to siphon money from other government accounts because he wanted to spend $8 billion on wall construction. The funds include $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.The president’s adversaries say the emergency declaration was an illegal attempt to ignore Congress, which authorized far less wall spending than Trump wanted.“",

A confirmation vote was expected to be held on Tuesday. The nomination requires 60 votes to succeed. Democrats control 55 seats in the 100-seat Senate.On Tuesday, Sen. Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican, threatened to block the nomination on procedural grounds, delaying it until next week if the Senate failed to come to a quick agreement on a vote to move ahead.“If I continue to be denied a vote on this nomination, then the nomination process is broken and it is my intention to seek every opportunity to force my colleagues to confront the consequences of the failure of the majority to abide by precedent, tradition, and the Constitution itself in its treatment of this nomination,” Mr. Bunning said in a statement.Mr. Obama announced the nomination on May 10, and has had more than 50 meetings on Capitol Hill with senators on her behalf.Ms. Kagan, 50, of New York, is a former law professor at Harvard University. If confirmed, she would become the fourth woman and second liberal on the nine-member court.During Senate hearings, she has drawn praise for her demeanor and legal thinking, but has also faced criticism for her stance on several issues, including the Supreme Court’s 1996 opinion in U.S. v. Morrison that found an automatic appeal to the Supremes of a criminal conviction should be barred if a state appeals court hasn’t considered the issue in the last 12 months.The House in April voted unanimously to support an effort by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would have required appeals of the Morrison decision to the Supreme Court to be accepted even if state courts failed to rule within a year, as required under the law.Mr. Hatch says he still favors her nomination. But Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told the Washington Times that if she had a position on the issue, “that could be a show-stopper for me.”",

This is the third year in a row that fewer than half of students believe the country will be better off in a decade.These results are from an annual poll conducted for the last 15 years by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) to measure the attitudes of young people aged 15 about education, society, the economy, democracy, and political participation around the world.In the 2003 poll, more than half of 15-year-olds said that by 2020 the U.S. would be better off than it is today, but fewer than half of the students asked this year agreed, and their level of belief has fallen steadily in the intervening years. Today, 40% of U.S. students say the nation will be better off 10 years from now, which is down from 44% in 2007 and 50% in 2003. Meanwhile, the percentage of students who say that in 2020 the U.S. will be worse off than it is now (47%) has increased from 39% in 2007, and 41% in 2003.In contrast to the trend among students as a whole, the percentage of high school seniors who say they plan to attend college has remained relatively steady. Last year, 81% of seniors said they would go to college, and that number was 82% this year.The 2008 poll also measured students' attitudes on two other issues -- global warming and the war in Iraq. On both of these, the poll results were similar to previous years. On global warming, 68% of U.S. students said that global warming is occurring, virtually unchanged from last year's 73%. On the war in Iraq, 68% said the war was a mistake, up from 65% last year.Gallup has asked an equivalent question of adults twice in the last 15 years.",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him.

From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately. At the time of the shooting, the market was full of many people, including many young girls and women buying and selling produce,\" said Colville.

The main opposition Republican People’s Party is accusing the council of dragging the country into the past with its proposal that schools teach the now-defunct Ottoman language used during Turkey’s imperial past.But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has strongly attacked critics.\"There are those who do not want the Ottoman language to be learned and taught,\" he said, \" ... but whether they want it or not, Ottoman will be learned and taught in this country.\"The National Education Council, which advises Turkey's Ministry of Education, called for compulsory religious classes in high schools to be doubled to two hours a week and extended to all ages. The council also said nursery schools should have what it calls \"values education.\"Political columnist Cengiz Aktar of the Zaman Today newspaper, who also teaches at Suleyman Sah University, said the reforms fit well with Erdogan’s objectives.\"For years, Erdogan wanted to create a new, pious youth, ethically correct according to the canons of his mind and his lecture of Islam, and he is just putting this into practice,\" Aktar said.Under Erdogan’s rule as prime minister, religious schools, known as imam hatips, have dramatically increased, from 65,000 children being enrolled in 2004 to more than one million today.The schools have 13 hours a week of religious training and strict segregation of boys and girls. In the past couple of years, many secular schools have been converted to imam hatips, in many cases with little warning to parents.\"It was a big surprise,\" one mother said.",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy?

His order applies to two high-priority projects to replace 51 miles (82 kilometers) of fence in two areas on the Mexican border.Gilliam issued the ruling after hearing arguments last week in two cases. California and 19 other states brought one lawsuit; the Sierra Club and a coalition of communities along the border brought the other. His ruling was the first of several lawsuits against Trump’s controversial decision to bypass the normal appropriations process to pay for his long-sought wall.Gilliam, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on arguments that the president was wrongly ignoring Congress’ wishes.“Congress’s ‘absolute’ control over federal expenditures — even when that control may frustrate the desires of the Executive Branch regarding initiatives it views as important — is not a bug in our constitutional system. It is a feature of that system, and an essential one,” he wrote in his 56-page opinion.A judge in Washington, D.C., is hearing a similar challenge brought by the U.S. House of Representatives that argued the money shifting violates the constitution.",

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says.

The tap-dancing extravaganza, about a chorus girl turned big star, will tour six other Chinese cities this year.This Broadway production is the first to have such an extensive touring scheduled in China and many more blockbuster musicals are expected to follow.Broadway musicals - showcasing a lot of dancing and singing - are finding their way into theaters that have previously only showed traditional Chinese opera and patriotic dramas. Last year, Chinese audiences saw \"West Side Story\", \"The Sound of Music\" and \"The Lion King\".U.S. producers and promoters say China's market liberalization and growing prosperity are fueling demand for Western theater.Chris Verrill directs a local production of another Tony-award winner \"Guys and Dolls\" at the Beijing Playhouse. \"The next big thing that grows after the economy is the arts. And I think English-language theater, Broadway musicals and all forms of art are being raised because of that. We're sort of riding a wave,\" he said.Some foreign theater productions such as the French revolution-themed \"Les Miserables\" have been staged in China in recent years, but for limited runs.In 2005, China's Ministry of Culture allowed foreign investments into the entertainment industry, allowing the creation of joint venture theater production companies.",

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

Most have been women and children whose existence in a labyrinth of underground caves and tunnels was unknown to the fighters.In the last two weeks, many fighters appeared to be among those evacuating. But an unknown number of militants and civilians remain inside, refusing to surrender.“We are facing several difficulties regarding the operations,” SDF commander Kino Gabriel told reporters outside Baghouz on Sunday.He cited the large number of mines and explosive devices planted by IS and the existence of tunnels and hideouts beneath the ground that are being used by the militants to attack SDF forces or defend themselves.The camp is all that remains of a self-declared Islamic “caliphate” that once sprawled across large parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq.",

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country.

They are in our cities and that is even more dangerous.\" Pakistan has battled Taliban militants in its northwest tribal areas since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the fighting is now moving closer to population centers, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee.Professor Hoodbhoy says the government for years tried to ignore or minimize the spreading influence of the militants, without acknowledging that the situation continued to worsen. \"The present situation is where religious extremists - whether they be the Taliban or whether they be one of the very many other jihaidst groups that were early on nurtured by the Pakistan army - they are pretty much beyond control now,\" Hoodbhoy said.",

The audio used is edited from his real remarks.Former President Ronald Reagan appears in Western attire, as he might appear at his Santa Barbara ranch, but as a hologram, on display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Oct. 10, 2018.“We wanted to make President Reagan as lifelike as possible,” said John Heubusch, executive director of the Reagan Foundation. “It’s a stunning experience.”In two other holograms, Reagan appears in a suit and tie inside the Oval Office and in horseback riding pants, carrying a lasso alongside his dog, Victory, at his beloved ranch. All three holograms will be on display to visitors of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, west of Los Angeles, starting Thursday.They will be shown in a specially designed room that will be the first stop for guests.",

But U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States was deeply concerned. She said new Jewish settlement construction could worsen a difficult situation and would not contribute to efforts to reduce tensions.Psaki also condemned an arson attack on a mosque in the West Bank on Wednesday, apparently carried out by Israeli extremists. She said hateful actions against a place of worship are never justified.Secretary of State John Kerry plans to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during a visit to Jordan on Thursday.Much of the recent violence in Israel has stemmed from the dispute over the Temple Mount, a holy site that Muslims call the al-Aqsa mosque. It is revered by Muslims and Jews.The long-simmering dispute over the site worsened this month when Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian gunman who had seriously wounded a U.S.-born rabbi. The rabbi had been part of a conference on expanding the rights of Jews to worship at the site.Also Wednesday, Israel's foreign ministry said it had no intention of cooperating with a U.N.",

The system's ability to intercept enemy missiles fills a gap in the current missile defense system deployed on the Korean Peninsula.The deployment, however, has encountered strong opposition from China, which is concerned that THAAD will undermine the strategic deterrence of China's long- and mid-range missiles, as well as the regional military balance.FILE - People watch a TV screen showing a file footage of a missile launch conducted by North Korea, at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, March 18, 2016.Rose also said the United States understands China's concerns, and has always hoped to explain that the deployment will not affect China's strategic deterrent.\"THAAD's single-stage interceptors deployed in [South Korea] would not have the range or capability to intercept Chinese ICBMs headed to the United States,\" he said. \"It is pure physics.\"",

Mr. Musharraf discussed the issue earlier in the day with President Bush.Bush administration officials have given a mixed picture of Pakistan's role in policing the border region, saying it has been effective against members of the al-Qaida terrorist organization, but less so in stopping cross-border forays by remnants of Afghanistan's Taleban regime.In a U.N. General Assembly address that followed a morning meeting with President Bush, Mr. Musharraf said the October 9 presidential election in Afghanistan will be an important landmark in that country's progress toward democracy and stability. He said Pakistan will do all it can to see that the process succeeds, but that Afghanistan must also act to bolster its own security.\"Pakistan will do all it can to prevent terrorists from using our territory to disrupt the Afghan election process,\" said President Musharraf. \"The subsequent parliamentary elections in April 2005 would also augur well for self governance in Afghanistan. While the political channel is progressing well and we wish President Karzai all success, the process of rebuilding the Afghan national army and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan needs to be accelerated to install durable peace in Afghanistan.\"Mr.",

However, conditions for the elections, originally scheduled for October, remain imperfect. The poll has been marred by widespread logistical problems, claims of vote-rigging, the post-election period might also be difficult to manage. Expectations were high in Bangui ahead of Wednesday’s vote. Outside one polling station in the neighborhood of Castor, near the city center, impatient voters hoping to turn a page on the country’s three-year long conflict lined up before dawn.Jean-Philipe Dora, a lawyer, said the population was ready for change.Dora said over the last three years life has been suspended. People live in poverty. He said that is why we have to choose the right leader, someone who can reconcile and reunite the country and bring hope to the population. Voters at some stations had to wait an extra hour or two, due to last-minute logistical problems.Voters are waiting in Bangui for presidential vote, Bangui Dec. 30, 2015.“We were supposed to open at 6 a.m.,\" said Bienvenue Ngouabangi, an electoral worker manning a polling station. He said because the material arrived late, the truck didn’t bring it here, so the polling station opened later. He said they will catch up. The electoral code said the station should be open for ten hours. Even if they have to stay open late, everyone will be able to vote.",

However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R. The announcement came amid public outrage after Chadian forces opened fire in Bangui's PK12 neighborhood on March 29.",

Tens of thousands of South Africans donned bright colors and marched to his official residence in central Pretoria, singing and dancing as they made their way through the streets.But they were not bringing birthday wishes.Instead, tens of thousands of South Africans massed on the president’s front lawn to ask the increasingly unpopular leader to leave office. Seven major opposition parties organized Wednesday’s march at Pretoria’s Union Buildings, and said they will continue to loudly, and peacefully, protest Zuma for the duration of his term, which is set to end in 2019.South African President Jacob Zuma attends a commemoration for anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani in Boksburg, South Africa, April 10, 2017.\"Zuma is no longer a credible president of South Africa,\" far-left political leader Julius Malema told the ebullient crowd.The president has already earned many critics for a raft of long-simmering corruption scandals.
