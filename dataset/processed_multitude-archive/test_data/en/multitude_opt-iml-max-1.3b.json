        "text": "in the UK, EU, Afghanistan, and PakistanThe British government’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office recently released data showing a number of foreign spies suspected of having breached UK government surveillance systems may not be the only perpetrators. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) released data showing that in addition to an already known list of British spies with high-risk intelligence, a total of 12 suspected terrorists have been questioned by British security services with information suggesting that they may have also accessed UK systems that are being monitored by the NSA. These suspects include:• A “person of interest” in a 2007 shooting at the London Stock Exchange that resulted in four fatalities, and one police officer being seriously injured.• The former chief of Pakistan’s national intelligence agency, who reportedly fled to the US in 2009 after being questioned by UK intelligence about his role in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.• Pakistani-born suspect Abdul Hafiz, who had reportedly traveled to the UK under false pretenses, and was questioned by the OSS in late 2006 in the case of an alleged plot to kill a British soldier.• Abdul Rahman, a suspect in the murder of a police officer that took place the following year, who was questioned by the UK security service (CIS) after being “identified as a possible suspect in the death of Detective Constable David James,” who had been involved in the investigation into the death of two men who were murdered in a suspected murder-for-hire plot.• A suspect in the 2006 murder of a police officer, who was reportedly involved in the investigation into the case and who was questioned by the CIS.In addition, the British government revealed that in an effort to protect UK spy targets, intelligence sources were sent overseas to question suspects. In the UK, for instance, intelligence sources were sent to the US to question suspects linked to the 2007 London Stock Exchange shooting. In the US, the same sources were flown to Pakistan to question suspects associated with a 2006 “plot to murder a British soldier at a NATO base in the country,” though the source of the attack remains a mystery. In some cases, the source of the attack has still not been identified.The information released by the British government to the OSS shows that a number of the suspects were under suspicion but that some have not been arrested.",

He is going to be very worried about that. I don’t know how that will go. But I think that the US military is probably going to want to be very close to the base if Kim Jong Un tries something. That would probably be the end of the strategy of getting to Pyongyang.I think that the US would prefer to see an economic relationship, and that would also be something that we do have.The analyst thinks that any US military action against North Korea would probably lead to another attack by North Korea.And he warns that Kim Jong Un would have no choice but to invade South Korea if the US does anything to him.So I think that the US strategy will be to get as close as they can to South Korea. That will probably be to the port in Pyeongchang. I don’t know how that will go but that is part of the plan.But I think that the US and other nations should probably look at a range of diplomatic techniques, including military ones, in order to make sure that Kim Jong Un’s regime doesn’t have the capacity to launch a nuclear strike against its neighbours.North Korea may not be using nuclear weapons against US forces in the near future, but the chances of its regime going nuclear are rising every day.This could lead to Kim Jong Un trying to build nuclear weapons that have a greater effect than conventional weapons.",

He said it was because Muslims are not allowed to enter during prayers.The incident came a day after police officers escorted a Jewish man into a synagogue and allowed him inside.There have been multiple incidents in recent weeks where Muslim-majority mosques have barred men from attending services.The New York police department said Friday that the man who was refused entry at the mosque has a complaint pending with it. The police department declined to provide further information.The incident is not a national problem. There are no major mosques in the United States that have barred men from attendance in recent years, and there is no report of incidents in which men have been turned away because they are Jewish.But there have been several incidents in which groups of Muslims have attacked and defaced Jewish symbols in response to such incidents.There have been multiple incidents in recent weeks where Muslim-majority mosques have barred men from attending services.",

This request was submitted as a statement of Nigeria's intention to take action against atrocities by Boko Haram. Nigeria's actions are in response to a letter of request sent to the ICC by the U.S. State Department in 2014.Amnesty International's request for action against crimes committed by Boko Haram is an important step in the ongoing struggle to end crimes against humanity perpetrated by Boko Haram.Boko Haram is responsible for committing atrocities on a horrific scale against civilians in Nigeria's Sambisa Forest, where over 250,000 people were displaced and some 300,000 people have fled their homes. The Sambisa Forest has been declared as a humanitarian crisis because its nature, scale and magnitude of destruction make it difficult to provide food for all displaced people in need.The Sambisa Forest has been subjected to extensive destruction, including the destruction of more than half a million trees and a significant number of animal farms in order to ensure Boko Haram's operational activities.Amnesty International is concerned that it is now increasingly clear that many of these crimes were committed at the hands of armed groups who use the forest to carry out their operations and have caused serious humanitarian concern for the people living in and near the forest.The situation calls for a full investigation into these crimes, which would enable full accountability and accountability for those responsible. The United States of America also needs to take action to ensure that the crimes committed by these armed groups are fully investigated and properly punished.Boko Haram's brutal persecution of thousands of people for the crime of trying to leave the Sambisa Forest and return to their homes, is an urgent humanitarian issue in need of urgent attention. This attack should serve as a call for an international investigation into the Sambisa Forest crimes committed by Boko Haram and a call to the ICC to prosecute war criminals.In a letter to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on 2 December 2017, Nigeria's Justice Minister, and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, confirmed Nigeria's intention to take action against atrocities committed by Boko Haram.It is now time for the ICC to initiate an investigation and to fully investigate the crimes committed in Sambisa Forest.",

(File Image)BANGKOK, Thailand, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's win in a general election on Sunday could trigger a power struggle within the ruling alliance that could split the main opposition parties, analysts said.Prayuth's election victory has raised hopes among his supporters of restoring Thai democracy, but those hopes could also lead to conflict between his two main rival parties, the Future Forward party led by former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, and an opposition alliance led by former Deputy PM Prasit Doophanop, both of whom have said they are prepared to sit together in a new Thai-led government.Prayuth's party won 35% of the vote, just shy of the 38% needed for a simple majority in parliament and a parliamentary majority to enact laws, but both the Future Forward and Prasit parties have been under pressure to sit together in a new government after both parties won more than 10% of the vote in a separate national survey.But Prasit and Future Forward, whose supporters have demanded an immediate power-sharing agreement, have so far stuck with their pledge of holding \"pre-vote consultations\" to discuss which party or candidates to support in future elections.Future Forward said in a statement it was prepared to \"agree or disagree\" with any political party, but said it would not sit with a \"fascist regime\" and urged the public to rally on Sunday in support of the party and the government.\"If Prayuth's party is accepted by both Prasit's party and Future Forward's party in a government, the future is very bright,\" said Somsak Setboonach, political science lecturer at Thammasat University.\"However, this will be difficult if the Future Forward party and Prasit's party fail to work together as one government, as both parties will have different interests and views on future politics.\"Thammasat University Political Science Professor Chotisol Tatsirasri said that Prasit and Future Forward had similar aims and would work for an independent administration in a post-war Thailand.But he added that the two parties had different strategies to achieve the goal.\"",

Sen.

        "text": "A newly released video by a U.S. Army major-general that aims to provide Islamabad with a military strategy for stabilization of Afghanistan shows how the American strategy for Afghanistan has evolved. For the past several years, the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan was primarily centered around counter-terrorism and military presence. But since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in April, U.S. military strategy has changed. It has shifted toward countering the Taliban, especially in the south.In a video released last week by Army Maj. Gen. Chris Donahue, deputy director of the U.S. military's Center for International Communication, he lays out some of the issues and challenges that American forces will face during their operations in Pakistan.Among these, Donahue lays out the need for U.S. forces to train Afghan forces to fight off the Taliban insurgency and to provide a military solution that includes economic development as an option for the Afghan people. In his views, the Taliban is not a nation. Instead, he believes that what Pakistan needs is the creation of a stable, democratic, and prosperous nation.\"We will use the same strategy we have used in South Africa. [It is] to promote stability, to assist the people in Afghanistan, and to have a stable and peaceful region. It will not be about 'taking out' the Taliban, but it will be about'making Pakistan work, make Pakistan a better nation and a safer nation.' And that's what we will be doing,\" Donahue says in the video.It will not be about \"taking out\" the Taliban, but it will be about \"making Pakistan work, make Pakistan a better nation and a safer nation,\" he added.Earlier in his speech, Donahue said that Pakistan's security and economic problems stem from its foreign policy of supporting Islamist groups who don't believe in democracy and are hostile to the United States and NATO.\"",

But then he decided to use his connections as a real estate developer to help him get into politics with a \"Trump Organization\" and to build a presidential campaign that is currently embroiled in controversy.There are, of course, some caveats to this whole situation. Trump may not be as wealthy as he claims, and he has been accused of conflicts of interest with his business empire. But it's hard to deny that he's successfully built his brand around the idea of a Trump in the White House and a Trump presidency.Ivanka Trump has always been the president's daughter-in-law, but she has found her place in the White House not merely through serving as a political pawn, but by building the Trump brand and creating the political and financial benefits her family and business has found.While Trump is no longer in the public eye, the Trump family's business has remained in business and continues to grow.While the Trump family's business is still doing well, it has managed to avoid scandals like those involving her father, who was accused of mistreating women, or her brother, who was accused of taking money from foreign governments without their permission. This is largely thanks to the Trump brand, which is being built on the success and goodwill her family has managed to create with a loyal following.\"I know people think the Trump family is corrupt,\" Ivanka Trump said recently during a discussion about women and leadership with the Women's Business Council of New York City. \"I hope they believe that because the fact is the Trump family's businesses are doing really well.

If consumer confidence stays this weak, it would be difficult for the economy to rebound,” said Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics.Consumers have been the main engine of economic growth so far this year. The weak retail sales come on the heels of a disappointing consumer spending reading last week. Analysts expected consumer spending to rise a mere 0.1 percent in October.U.S. stocks declined on Monday in reaction to the disappointing retail sales numbers, while bonds were trading with some upside momentum as the market digested the data. The stock market is down by roughly 1 percent over the last several days as investors fretted that economic growth will slow further without another financial stimulus effort.Retail sales can be a reliable indicator of consumer spending but are a lagging indicator because it doesn't always happen in the same month. The Federal Reserve will be looking closely at consumer spending figures when it meets on Dec. 14-15 to make an interest rate decision. The Fed has pledged to keep interest rates low to support the U.S. economic recovery.",

In the Philippines, the flu death toll has doubled with deaths recorded in every province.Experts warn against over-battling the virus since it is still not known to be fully understood, causing a lot of fear among the public.Meanwhile, other countries across the region have stepped up their efforts to fight the virus.Meanwhile, South Korea is seeing a sharp rise in infections from the new strain of bird flu. On Wednesday, health authorities in the country confirmed that the flu has spread to the rest of the country.The country's Health Ministry said that the new strain of the virus has already reached at least 35 people in a city of more than 500,000.Health officials say that so far they have only found the virus in samples from one man.South Korean officials warn the public to maintain preventive measures, including maintaining an extra distance from people who show symptoms of bird flu, avoid close contact with wild birds and disinfect all contact surfaces after visiting wild bird areas.Meanwhile, Thailand's Agriculture Ministry announced it would deploy 150 million baht to support the country's farms affected by the outbreak of bird flu.However, the move did not go over well with some, as residents were already experiencing the effects of the disease.",

Some said their action was retaliation for the decision of the top court to reduce the salary of teachers by half during one of the biggest waves of anti-government protests in the country’s history.The protesters chanted the term “el hombre al que esta perdido,” or “the man who fell asleep” in reference to the five Supreme Court justices.“I want you to understand this,” Venezuelan lawyer Edgar Zambrano said in video filmed by the prosecutor. “This is not a joke. You and your fellow magistrates were complicit in the killing of two people, in the face of international support. And you are asking that the president not be given the opportunity to investigate these crimes and hold the perpetrators accountable?”",

And they also noted that the State Department's policy on Rwanda has changed dramatically in recent years.In 2014, State was so frustrated with the government's human rights abuses that it imposed economic sanctions.

Some of them fear they are moving toward illiberalism and may become more difficult to control.The new populist, illiberal Europe is beginning to resemble the US and Western Europe of the 1930s, but without the economic and political stability. Europe’s leaders may finally be listening.One of the key elements of illiberalism is the use of the legal system to prevent people from exercising democracy. It may be seen as the new tyranny of the masses. In the United States during the 1920s, popular movements like the League of Labor forced the government to provide better civil rights, and helped turn the nation from a conservative to a progressive nation. It is often thought that the Great Depression was caused by the excesses of the New Deal. In Europe, illiberal governments were able to take advantage of the economic dislocation of the Great Depression to prevent political debate on important issues.In the last three years, Europe’s populist and illiberal movements have moved beyond the traditional boundaries of traditional political alliances. Now they are challenging not only the traditional parties but also the political institutions of the European Union.For example, European leaders reacted furiously to a recent report from French President Emmanuel Macron, who made a speech to an audience of the European Parliament denouncing racism and anti-Semitism in Europe. Macron, a former investment banker, is making an attempt to rebrand the movement’s aims by portraying himself as a champion of liberal values. He is right: his report found that many of Europe’s anti-immigrant parties were led by individuals with questionable or even dubious backgrounds and many of them shared little if any of Europe’s liberal values.",

The country did not report any new cases in 2020.“The country has performed extremely well over the last 10 years,” said Dr. Dileep Nangula, WHO’s assistant director-general for immunization.The Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, began vaccinating its people in 2017, but the number of confirmed cases has fallen sharply as a result of a “concerted national immunization campaign.”",

The doctors say their pay is too low.The president's warning followed a government decision to impose a nationwide lockdown that began on Friday to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\"No one is in a better position to judge your attitude in terms of being able to fight the corona crisis than the president himself,\" said Robert Mugabe, who heads Zimbabwe's ruling party.The government imposed the lockdown after more than 300 people attended a private funeral — one of several events that have been linked to the coronavirus — at a mosque in Harare's affluent Mvura suburb.The government ordered people attending funerals to wear masks and to be confined to their homes for 14 days following the funeral.On Saturday, more than 100 doctors and nurses who had staged strikes for better pay staged another protest at one of Zimbabwe's largest state hospitals in Harare's capital, demanding better working conditions and their salaries should be increased to $100 ($0.01 per hour), which they say is below the poverty line.\"The current pay levels at some state hospitals are insufficient to care for our patients,\" said doctor James Sanyang. \"It is in this regard that we would like to express our strong displeasure in the face of the employer.\"",

They will have to be used once to register, and be given to any person who wants to take them, according to the site, in exchange for money.The basilica’s website said: “The first payment is given to the individual who takes the ticket and gives it to the first person to come and take it. A further payment is made at a later time when the same ticket is taken by another person.”The bank is offering a series of tie designs that can be given to the donors to mark their support.The website explained: “The Basilica is seeking donations, either in the form of cash, goods, or services. It is not expected to be able to collect money for the projects.”Basilica officials said that donations would also be accepted at the door of the basilica, and that all donations would be used for the various parish projects.According to the basilica, the idea is that the new cards will be used as a “paperless” channel, allowing donors to easily transfer funds from their bank accounts to the church’s coffers.The basilica will take the cards from their respective banks.The cards will have a QR code and a unique identification number which will be sent to the bank.",

On Tuesday, he issued a temporary nationwide stay on work on the Rio Grande Valley of Texas after a similar ruling in Arizona.Texas and Arizona argued that they needed the wall to protect against crime and drug smuggling.The judge said in his ruling that he did not think his order would result in the border being “virtually empty,” a conclusion that was contested by Texas officials.Moulton said he had to weigh whether he could keep the wall in place for the time being while the government appeals the case. It’s possible that the next hearing in the case will not be held in his courtroom.Moulton said he was concerned that parts of the wall would be built to look more like posts and less like the concrete sections of fencing that have been in place in places along the Mexican border.In April, Moulton ordered that parts of a border fence in eastern New Mexico must be taken down and that a new type of mesh barrier — one made of steel — be used. In his ruling Tuesday, Moulton stopped short of ordering the entire fence, but he noted that it could include some parts of it.Trump has pledged to construct 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to build new sections where existing walls fall short. Moulton’s decision makes it possible that some of the construction will be done in Texas, where new barriers are not permitted.",

Democratic voters are likely to cast their ballot before then but, before then, have plenty of other things to consider.Here’s a look at some of the things that will come up during the debate and the things they have said about race relations, the climate and the economy, and everything in between.The first presidential debate, in June, was dominated by issues like sexual misconduct, racial injustice and white privilege.But in the last debate, the stage was expanded to include three more African American candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.); and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).That means that the first six of the first 14 candidates qualified for the second debate. With that amount of candidates, there will be plenty of hot topics.Here is a roundup of the most notable quotes from both the Democratic candidates and the moderator from the debate:Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke speaks onstage at a debate hosted by PBS on Oct. 15, 2019, in Los Angeles.

She also said she’d support a ban on the use of the pesticide neonicotinoid.Climate change and energyThis isn’t a debate the Democratic nominee should lose, because it is the central theme of the next four years.",

David Petraeus put it in his 2013 memoir.During the early years, Petraeus said, the war was often \"a grind,\" with combatant commanders trying to control the environment and maintain momentum with limited supplies.A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US is no longer trying to win every day, but instead is trying to destroy al-Qaeda's leadership and prevent its ability to operate in the region.The shift of focus away from victory in the war and toward destroying al-Qaeda leaders began in 2018, when President Donald Trump was elected, the official said.Al-Qaeda, the former Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan (AQA) leader and the world's top al-Qaeda terrorist organization in 2011, has been struggling in Afghanistan in recent years. The Taliban, the hardline Islamist group that rules Afghanistan, has been on the defensive against the US-backed Afghan government since 2015.",

Most notable has been the case of the Lebanese startup of Echos Digital Media.Lebanese startups have been part of social initiatives in different ways, starting with a local nonprofit that helped the poor get mobile phones for them, then with a charitable charity that provides water.While there is obviously an element of profit-making involved in some of the ideas, the idea of starting a business in a country like Lebanon involves far more than just making a quick buck.It is not surprising that some of the first and most successful entrepreneurs here come from the communities that they are trying to impact.For the new arrivals to Lebanon, and all of those already here, it can be challenging to navigate the startup world. There are many great resources to get an idea started, but the hard part is getting it funded. There are also a lot of things that you might want to know that you don’t realize you need or can’t afford to do yourself or the startup doesn’t need to pay you to do it.Lebanon, like many countries around the globe is suffering a financial crisis and is trying to fix it one piece of the puzzle at a time. In many of the developing countries, the government’s only interest is in ensuring that the companies and industries are creating the jobs that they can’t hire locally.However, in some cases, the companies have to spend more money than they would like, or the companies have to invest even more money to try to create jobs, not just the people that are employed in their businesses.",

It is not up for debate that there are millions of people who want [Trump] to be removed. It is also not up for debate that the election is not secure for him, in the same way that the UK, Spain, and France elections are secure,\" the source said.The UK's House of Commons, for instance, voted to formally accept Brexit, while Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez won a confidence vote.The United States, on the other hand, is one of the most secure countries in the world, the source added.On Thursday, the US Electoral College confirmed the election results and the Senate also confirmed them.As a result, President-elect Joe Biden will now be inaugurated to his second four-year term. Trump will take up his post as a Cabinet member.",

The conflict began in August 2008 when Georgian forces captured and occupied the territory. Since then, Russia has been fighting the separatists, who it considers part of the Georgian side.The United States has offered a number of solutions for peace between the sides, including a referendum on independence. The United States also has offered to mediate, but the Georgian side rejected them, saying that they would have been satisfied with a peace deal that was only a resolution to the long-standing conflict.US President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged an end to bloodshed on the peninsula.\"All lives are worth fighting for,\" Trump said, speaking at a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\"I want there to be peace and for peace to come, so no lives should be lost, and if lives are lost there will be an even greater crisis,\" Trump said, urging for the ceasefire to be implemented.In response, the Georgian side noted that the Russian-backed separatists continued to violate ceasefire agreements by fighting.\"The Russian Federation continues to violate all the agreements related to ceasefire. In the last three years, as of August 15, the Russian Federation and its armed forces have committed over 4,500 violations of ceasefire. Therefore, this is an open war,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.The statement was signed by Georgian Foreign Minister David Zalkaliani.",

This is compared to the global figure of 15 per cent.In addition, 60 per cent of West African schools (38.3 million students) were under-resourced with insufficient funding for education and health, compared to the global figure of 20 per cent.The report also found that West African schools had poor environmental conditions and sanitation, as well as poor environmental conditions in schools themselves and in the environments of the surrounding communities.The report concludes that it would be possible to close almost half (47.5 per cent) of the schools in the area, with only 4.1 per cent (8.9 million students) remaining open.This would mean, in theory, that every high school would be closed, and nearly 1.5 million young people would be able to leave the region for good. But it would also mean a huge economic decline and joblessness in a region that has experienced huge growth since the early 2000s.The total cost of the school system was estimated at $2,300 per student, but many schools in the region already have high operating costs.The report suggests that the region would have to raise the $3 billion the report says it needs to properly improve the school systems, rather than just closing them, if the region wants to achieve full economic development.",

But the policy is likely to be extended until the next national election in 2021 because voter discontent still deepens as economic gains fade.Japanese voters have increasingly taken issue with Abe, who is on his third term as prime minister, due to his handling of the economic crisis stemming from the Fukushima nuclear accident.Fears that he might quit at the end of his first term have never materialized, but this year they could take a more decisive turn after a series of political setbacks and poor economic forecasts.Abe last month suffered a second blow after a string of major setbacks including a failed constitutional amendment, a government reshuffle and a lower house election called by the opposition.Abe's ruling bloc is facing a similar situation to that of the opposition during the last three decades, when powerful military and foreign governments sought to block any progress made by the prime minister during a period of relative political stability, forcing Abe to push to quickly solve problems.The ruling bloc is looking to hold on to power next year.\"We'll do our utmost to secure a stable Japan,\" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday, adding that the government was committed to Abe's second term.Analysts believe that the opposition will refrain from trying to force Abe from office.Abe's top priority in the run-up to the election will be deciding which of the six parties that are represented in the Diet -- including those from the major opposition parties -- will run for the top post.The ruling bloc has a simple majority in the upper house of parliament, but it relies on a support of at least 200 seats in the lower house to secure a majority. The conservative bloc will try to woo support from the major opposition parties by offering new and improved policies to attract the smaller parties to the bloc.Japan's economic fortunes have turned for the better but the political landscape remains shaky.",

Dhaka residents say his father, also named as Chowdhury, was one of those killed.While many Bangladeshis have openly talked about losing relatives to religious violence – such as the 1982 massacre that drove hundreds of thousands from India’s eastern border – few have shared experiences in the same way.“I know many people who have lost people, but I think they keep it inside and don’t talk about it,” said Zareed Rahman, a Dhaka resident and a former politician.In a recent interview on Bangladesh’s TV, he said that his uncle was killed in 1990. “He was a priest, but he was also killed. I remember his face. You can see his face and hair,” Rahman said, recounting his uncle’s fate as the priest.“I always keep the incident inside and keep it away from my family,” he told the anchor on Friday, and then asked “when are we going to face Islamic extremism and terrorism?”The interview prompted a flood of questions on how Bangladeshis could protect themselves, and on the country’s “soft” image and how such killings could harm the country.“No one should be afraid of Bangladesh,” said the anchor. “Let’s bring out the best in each other.”The anchor also expressed optimism about Bangladesh’s chances of becoming a leader in the regional peace dialogue, something Rahman hoped would happen as soon as possible.But while the anchors’ hope appears to be tempered by the reality, many Bangladeshis – including ordinary, law-abiding citizens – are now openly talking about their experience of violence from religion and extremism, despite the country’s strong tradition of tolerance, respect for civil liberties and an independent judiciary.“",

In his letter of resignation, he did say that he would leave the Board in good standing at the end of the day, which was certainly a sign that he was stepping down.This move comes on the heels of a major restructuring that will lead to the sale of GE’s entire industrial business.

A BYD electric car was recently unveiled in the Chinese market.One of the biggest reasons for the Trump administration wanting to cut a deal with China on trade is that the president claims that the U.S. has \"little to gain\" from a trade deal with the Chinese and that the trade war is bad for the U.S. business community.U.S. President Donald Trump is currently in a trade war with China, which is also in the process of putting a tariff on another U.S. product: steel.Read the original article on CNBC.

The lawsuit filed in Orange County alleges that more than 300 children in the Los Angeles Archdiocese may have been abused at the hands of Catholic priests over an 80-year span beginning in 1949.The lawsuit alleges that the dioceses, particularly in Southern California, covered up abusive priests by failing to keep accurate records of allegations of abuse and hiding documents about how the dioceses handled allegations. The plaintiffs allege that the dioceses allowed abusive priests to continue working within parishes and that they were also unwilling to deal with the victims and report cases of abuse.The allegations include that some dioceses allowed the abusive priests to continue working while they continued to be members of the community and kept church documents about allegations of abuse and attempts to cover up accusations from church officials.The lawsuits contend that the dioceses failed to investigate or protect the children who had been abused or did nothing about the records of abuse by abusing priests that they had already kept.\"These children have suffered the most grievous of injuries,\" according to the lawsuit, filed by two law firms, the National Child & Family Coalition in Sacramento and the Law Center for Children & Families in Los Angeles.The case seeks to force the Diocese of Orange to make public all records relating to claims of abuse against priests and to pay damages to all victims.The Orange Diocese denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday.\"While the Orange Diocese cannot, and will not, comment on the specific details of each case regarding which our priests are alleged to have abused children, we welcome the opportunity to examine the accusations,\" said Bishop John F.

[In Pictures: Images of Mars' Red Planet]\"We think that we could do it tomorrow, but we need to get samples, and we need to bring them back,\" he said.The MER mission will carry eight sample tubes that would be mounted on the rover. Once the samples are collected by MER, they will travel to Mars' surface, where they would be deposited on Earth's surface.In addition, the Curiosity rover mission will examine Mars' atmosphere and analyze the chemical compositions of rocks. That work is expected to be completed by late 2016.Both the Curiosity and MHLI missions are being managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, with funding from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The European Space Agency, or ESA, manages the ExoMars rover mission on behalf of the European Union.The MHLI mission will be led by a team of scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Other teams of scientists are working on a variety of other missions to Mars, including the Mars Odyssey orbiter, which is orbiting the Red Planet.

He reiterated his statement regarding migrants and asylum seekers in an interview that was aired on Monday's program of Bulgaria's Channel 1.\"I am not trying to be on the same page as the Greek, Italian or Bulgarian policy, or any of the other policies that are in favour of those arriving, and those fleeing,\" he said.He continued, \"I am calling to be open-minded.

The United Nations has warned that over 100 000 voting papers and electronic devices have been destroyed and are yet to be retrieved.This is what is making it difficult for the Commission of Presidential Elections to declare a winner as it could be challenged by the losing candidate.On Tuesday, the Electoral Board of the CAR held a press briefing to address the issue, where several top members of the political parties addressed them. Some of them insisted that their party won and would win the elections.The electoral board, however, explained that the process in the country requires a complex computer software in order for the results to be transmitted from the central data banks to the electoral commission. The central banks hold over 10 000, 000 of these data sheets.\"It is expected that there will be an overwhelming response, hence the delay. The commission would work towards restoring confidence to the general public by addressing their grievances as soon as possible,” the EC said.The CARs presidential election has been suspended since mid-August due to alleged electoral fraud. The EC said that the electoral commission is going to use satellite equipment that can capture information from the national electoral databases and transmit it to the commission’s headquarters in Lofa in Treloar, Togo.The EC had planned to conduct a re-run, if any, within a week, however, the CARs electoral commission decided to delay the elections in order for the EC to work on a new system to capture information from the databases.However, Togo’s President Faure Gnassingbe announced his decision to withdraw his candidacy for the upcoming elections, stating that he will remain on leave as head of state to ensure stability in the country.Mali, which is also embroiled in a political and religious crisis, said that it will hold elections after March 12th, 2019, as scheduled, without any delay.",

The agency estimates that more than 200 million Americans take medications that come with sodium.“It is our hope that these voluntary standards will provide the flexibility for manufacturers and producers to determine a consistent approach in meeting the requirements of the voluntary standards,” says FDA Commissioner David Kessler. “And our hope is that these standards will be used to help create a healthier food environment.”",

Some college-bound students chose to attend a \"better\" school because they could get a better education.But now that some schools have taken steps to ease the path for paying off student loans, things are getting a little strange.According to CNBC, now that a law has been passed to allow students to \"refinance\" their student loans, schools are starting to take an increasingly hands-on approach in making sure that all students are paying their loans every day, even if they fail to complete classes. That includes offering students a \"free\" college education from the schools in their home states.But as the law is changing, schools are starting to create more complicated programs for the families of college-bound students. These kids are being forced out of their home states so that their families can attend institutions of higher education, even if they don't really need to attend because the schools in their states are so much better than the ones they'd have to attend to attend to them.The latest controversy arose in Utah, where one of the schools is offering this type of tuition-reduction package to parents of students who don't make it into the schools they want:Under the program, if a student does not graduate from at least one of the schools that meet the criteria, their parents are automatically enrolled in the program and receive tuition remission, but they will still need to work to cover the costs of attending the schools.\"I don't want to go to Utah now, I really don't, but they've got a program that they think it might be best for our daughter,\" said Laura Wilson, the mother of a high school student.\"",

        "text": "IndustryA recent development in India’s fashion industry includes technology as one of the major trends shaping the future of fashion design. The advancement of technology is making it easier to create fashion wear and products which have already been incorporated in some of the leading brands. For instance, in 2015, Apple introduced the Apple Watch which is a popular technology based wear. The watch is equipped with different sensors which enable the users to monitor a lot of data about themselves. For example, the watch can send a message when the user is running out of time. There are apps available which are installed on the Apple Watch which can make the user stay connected with them anytime anywhere. Similarly, the smart watch can detect the temperature and can be adjusted according to the body’s needs. The watch can control the music and make call so that the user gets more information than can be communicated with human voice. These devices make fashion wear available in an even more sophisticated manner.The trend of using technology in fashion is also increasing as more consumers prefer to shop online. A study in 2016 reveals that almost 80% of all people today use computers to buy fashion and they also use technology to access their personal information. These devices enable the customers to stay connected with the brands they like.For instance, the Amazon app for android users, is a very popular application which enables the user to buy anything from Amazon.com even though not a huge number of people use this application for the purpose.The latest fashion trends also incorporate technology in their designs. In some cases, there is no visible change in the design but in some cases, there are changes happening. For example, an electronic wrist band such as an Apple Watch can be used to provide information about the wearer. Similar technology can be incorporated in the latest designs.With technology becoming more mainstream in fashion, consumers are not only consuming the latest trends but also buying them.In 2016, there were more than 70 million wearable devices that were sold. Some of these wearables even run software which controls the device. These electronic devices are becoming more and more popular.For instance, in 2013, a new Apple Watch was launched in order to provide an even more advanced level of functionality. This watch is able to collect data from the wearer and also be used to make calls and send text messages.The future of fashion is certainly going to be a lot of interesting developments involving technology and design.",

I hope, by writing this, I can answer your questions about yourself and make yourself seem more of a “person” than a “gimmick,” and a “pseudoperson.”The second Compassionate Care Award Award for the year, a few days before I was told by HumanKind that I could ask any “organization, charity or organization” to write me about myself, is supposed to be a “test.” What does that mean? I want to see what is really behind what I am doing and what I say. This is to help me see how far my “passive” self has “passive” feelings and a “passive” character that “passive” feelings don’t have. It isn’t necessarily that I am asking you to tell me what is going on in your life, but it does allow me to learn from what you write, and from what I write about you. This kind of “test” doesn’t tell you who you are, because you don’t write about a “you” and tell a “me” of who you want to be.",

Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader.

He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.

The food security situation there remains very serious. One is the insufficient grain supply on the market. The import requirement is huge?would the country be able to import that. If the country imports, would the people (be able to) afford to buy that. Do they have the purchasing power? What is the employment situation? What is the income situation? So all these factors have been compounding the overall food supply situation in the country,? he says.The situation also continues to worsen in Malawi.

The 17-track CD is titled Lucky Dube ? The Best Of. It features all the hits that made the South African musician a household name across the continent, and abroad. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation.

According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

A joint observer mission representing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and NATO said they had seen abuse of state resources in favor of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich.Opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko called on his supporters Monday to \"defend this victory\" in the streets, as the vote count continued in Ukraine's capital city Kiev. He called the official count a fraud, and appealed to the European Union to put pressure on the government to concede defeat in Sunday's pivotal election.The opposition leader alleges that fraud took place in eastern Ukraine, which is heavily populated by Russian speakers and where Mr. Yanukovich has his base of support.The opposition leader says turnout figures of 96 percent in that region appeared inflated, and he charges that buses transported many voters to different locales in order for them to vote more than once.International election monitors also reported widespread irregularities during Sunday's vote.Various exit polls late Sunday night indicated that Mr. Yushchenko enjoyed a substantial lead. However a spokesman for Mr. Yanukovich dismissed the opposition's claims, saying the exit polls were \"inaccurate and unrealistic.\"Tens of thousands of Mr.",

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says.

He gave only his first name, Christopher.\"They told me to kill my mother,\" he said, his voice barely audible.After being seized from his home by opposition soldiers at the age of 10 during a period of localized fighting, he said his mother came into the bush to plead with his commanders to set him free.\"When she came they told me to shoot her or I'd be killed instead,\" the boy said.",

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

Bush, Aung San Suu Kyi said the suspension of U.S. sanctions against Burma, rather than their full removal, will keep the pressure on the military to stay on track with political reforms. \"I sometimes feel that things, that people are too optimistic about the scene in Burma. You have to remember that the democratization process is not irreversible. I have said very openly that we can never look upon it as irreversible until such time as the military commits itself to democratization,\" she said.With abundant natural resources, Burma is ripe for new business.",

        "text": "BANGUI - Throngs of voters lined up at polling stations early Wednesday in the capital of the Central African Republic, ready to elect a new president and parliament who they hope will end years of conflict and division. However, conditions for the elections, originally scheduled for October, remain imperfect. The poll has been marred by widespread logistical problems, claims of vote-rigging, the post-election period might also be difficult to manage. Expectations were high in Bangui ahead of Wednesday’s vote. Outside one polling station in the neighborhood of Castor, near the city center, impatient voters hoping to turn a page on the country’s three-year long conflict lined up before dawn.Jean-Philipe Dora, a lawyer, said the population was ready for change.Dora said over the last three years life has been suspended. People live in poverty. He said that is why we have to choose the right leader, someone who can reconcile and reunite the country and bring hope to the population. Voters at some stations had to wait an extra hour or two, due to last-minute logistical problems.Voters are waiting in Bangui for presidential vote, Bangui Dec. 30, 2015.“We were supposed to open at 6 a.m.,\" said Bienvenue Ngouabangi, an electoral worker manning a polling station.

        "text": "BANGUI - Many people in the Central African Republic are welcoming Chad's decision to withdraw its troops from the African Union peacekeeping force in the country. However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R. The announcement came amid public outrage after Chadian forces opened fire in Bangui's PK12 neighborhood on March 29.",

Tens of thousands of South Africans donned bright colors and marched to his official residence in central Pretoria, singing and dancing as they made their way through the streets.But they were not bringing birthday wishes.Instead, tens of thousands of South Africans massed on the president’s front lawn to ask the increasingly unpopular leader to leave office. Seven major opposition parties organized Wednesday’s march at Pretoria’s Union Buildings, and said they will continue to loudly, and peacefully, protest Zuma for the duration of his term, which is set to end in 2019.South African President Jacob Zuma attends a commemoration for anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani in Boksburg, South Africa, April 10, 2017.\"Zuma is no longer a credible president of South Africa,\" far-left political leader Julius Malema told the ebullient crowd.The president has already earned many critics for a raft of long-simmering corruption scandals.
