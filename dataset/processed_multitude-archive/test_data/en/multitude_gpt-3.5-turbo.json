The situation is particularly dire in Zimbabwe, where the number of people facing food shortages has doubled since last year. Malawi and Zambia are also among the hardest-hit countries, with millions of people facing severe hunger.The UN has warned that the situation is likely to worsen in the coming months, as the region enters the peak of the lean season. The organization is appealing for $700 million in aid to help address the crisis, but so far, only a fraction of the funds have been pledged.The situation in Southern Africa is a stark reminder of the urgent need for long-term solutions to address the root causes of hunger and poverty. Climate change, conflict, and economic inequality are all contributing to the crisis, and will continue to do so unless action is taken to address these underlying issues.In the short term, however, it is vital that aid is delivered to those in need, and that governments and international organizations work together to provide emergency assistance and support the most vulnerable communities.",

The country's anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), will conduct inspections on 78 state-owned enterprises in the country, according to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.The inspections aim to improve governance, as well as uncovering any corruption or misconduct. The CCDI has said that it will focus on areas such as bidding and procurement, financial management, and the use of public funds. In addition, the watchdog will examine the backgrounds of senior management, to ensure that they have not been involved in any illegal or unethical activities.State-owned enterprises have been the target of China's anti-corruption campaign for several years, as they are seen as particularly vulnerable to misconduct and graft. The CCDI has already investigated several high-profile cases, including the former head of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the former chairman of China's biggest nuclear power producer.Analysts suggest that the latest round of inspections reflects President Xi Jinping's continued commitment to tackling corruption, as well as his desire to maintain control over state-owned enterprises.",

The raids took place at two of Fernandez's properties in Buenos Aires and Patagonia, where authorities seized documents and electronic devices.Fernandez, who currently serves as a senator, has denied any wrongdoing and accused the current government of targeting her for political reasons. She has been implicated in several corruption cases, including a high-profile scandal involving public works contracts awarded to a construction company linked to her and her late husband.The raids come amid a turbulent period for Argentina, which is grappling with a deep economic crisis and high inflation. President Alberto Fernandez, who is no relation to the former president, has promised to tackle corruption and restore economic stability, but critics argue that his government has not done enough to address these issues.The investigation into Fernandez's alleged corruption has been ongoing for several years and has involved numerous high-profile figures in Argentine politics and business. The raids mark a significant development in the case and are likely to lead to further scrutiny of Fernandez and her associates.The former president remains a divisive figure in Argentina, with some seeing her as a champion of social justice and others viewing her as a symbol of corruption and political arrogance.

The majority of those in debt are middle-aged and elderly individuals who have limited income and assets to rely on.The study also found that households with elderly members are more likely to be indebted, as they often face higher healthcare costs. The rise in healthcare costs has caused an increase in household debt, with many households struggling to pay for necessary medical treatments.The Bank of Thailand has urged policymakers to address the issue and provide support for households struggling with debt. It has recommended increasing access to financial literacy programs and promoting financial planning for retirement.As the population ages, it is clear that there is a growing need for policies that support the financial well-being of households.

However, many conservationists and environmental groups have criticized the decision, arguing that the bluefin population is still not at a sustainable level and that removing protections could have dire consequences for the species in the long term.The bluefin tuna is one of the most valuable fish in the world, with individual fish selling for tens of thousands of dollars on the international market.

From the terrorist attacks in Paris to the devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have allowed individuals to express their thoughts and emotions in real-time, and have helped to connect people with loved ones who may have been affected by the tragedy.However, the same social media platforms that have helped unite people in times of tragedy have also been the source of division. In the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, for example, social media became a battleground for political debate and blame. The same tragedy that brought people together also highlighted the deep divisions in American society.Social media has also been used to spread misinformation and fake news in times of crisis. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, for example, photos and videos of sharks swimming through flooded streets went viral on social media, despite being completely fake. This misinformation can be dangerous and can further divide people in times of crisis.Overall, social media has the power to unite people in times of tragedy, but it also has the power to divide. It is important to use social media responsibly and to verify information before sharing it with others, especially in times of crisis.",

The decision was made after several high-profile incidents involving private security firms and their personnel, which resulted in loss of civilian lives and damage to public property.Afghanistan has been plagued by insecurity and conflict for decades, with the Taliban and other armed groups carrying out frequent attacks on civilians and security forces. Private security firms, which have been operating in the country since the US-led invasion in 2001, were intended to provide additional security for foreign embassies, aid organizations, and businesses.However, the firms have faced criticism for their lack of accountability and transparency, and have been accused of operating with impunity, committing human rights abuses, and fueling corruption. The move to abolish them is seen as a major step towards bringing the security situation under control and restoring public trust in the government.The decision has been welcomed by some, who argue that the firms have contributed to the instability in the country, while others have raised concerns about the impact on the thousands of personnel working for the firms, who will be left without jobs. The government has said that it will work to find alternative employment for those affected.The move comes at a critical time for Afghanistan, as the country prepares for peace talks with the Taliban, which are set to begin in Qatar in the coming weeks. The talks are seen as a crucial step towards ending the conflict, which has ravaged the country for years and claimed the lives of thousands of people.As the government moves to implement the ban on private security firms, it remains to be seen how effective it will be in improving the security situation in the country and restoring public confidence in the government's ability to provide security.",

Despite ongoing controversies and boycotts against her father, the brand's sales have increased in the past year, with profits soaring by 61% in 2016. According to an analysis by e-commerce aggregator Lyst, the first half of 2017 showed the brand's sales are up 46% compared to the same period in 2016. This increase is believed to be due, in part, to the publicity generated by Ivanka's role as an adviser to her father and her frequent appearances on the campaign trail during the US presidential election.The brand has also capitalized on its connection to politics by emphasizing its \"Made in America\" tagline and promoting its products as patriotic. However, this strategy has not been without controversy as reports have emerged that some of the brand's merchandise is still being produced overseas.Despite calls for Ivanka to separate herself from her brand to avoid conflicts of interest, she has retained her ownership stake but stepped down from her executive role in the company.

Sean Ryan, said that the fight against IS in Syria \"remains difficult\". He cited the presence of \"tough, battle-hardened fighters\" who have been using tunnels and other tactics to evade the coalition's offensive.According to reports, the coalition has been facing tough resistance from IS fighters in the town of Baghouz, where the group's last stronghold in Syria is located. The militants have reportedly been using civilians as human shields, making it difficult for the coalition to launch airstrikes.Despite the challenges, the coalition forces remain committed to defeating IS in Syria. \"The enduring defeat of ISIS remains our mission, and we will continue to work with our partners on the ground until that goal is achieved,\" Col. Ryan said.The US-led coalition has been fighting against IS in Syria since 2014. The group had captured vast swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq before the coalition launched its offensive.While the coalition has made significant gains against the group, IS remains a potent force in the region. The group has reportedly carried out attacks in recent months, including a suicide bombing in the city of Manbij in January that killed four Americans.The admission of difficulties by the US-backed forces underscores the challenges of defeating a group that has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability in the face of military pressure.

Despite efforts to improve the education system, students still struggle to receive quality education due to these issues.One of the major problems facing West African schools is a lack of funding. Many schools are underfunded and unable to provide basic resources such as textbooks, stationery, and equipment. This often results in overcrowded classrooms where students are forced to share resources, and teachers are unable to provide individual attention to all students.Corruption also plays a significant role in the state of West African schools. Funds meant for educational purposes are often diverted to personal accounts, leaving schools with even fewer resources. Teachers may also demand bribes from students in exchange for good grades, which further undermines the quality of education.Overcrowding is another major issue plaguing West African schools. The number of students in each class is often way beyond what is reasonable, making it difficult for students to learn effectively. This is compounded by a lack of teachers, which further exacerbates the problem.In conclusion, the state of West African schools remains a cause for concern as students continue to face significant challenges. To ensure that students receive quality education, governments need to prioritize funding for education, stamp out corruption and implement policies that reduce overcrowding. Until these issues are adequately addressed, students in West Africa will continue to struggle to receive the education they deserve.",

However, the government defended its actions and pointed to its efforts to revive the economy and contain the virus.The outcome of the vote was expected, as the ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in parliament. However, the opposition used the occasion to highlight the government's shortcomings and rally public support for their cause.The no-confidence vote is a traditional way of testing the strength of a government in Thailand, and has been used several times in the past. Despite surviving this challenge, the Prime Minister and his government still face numerous challenges, including the ongoing pandemic, a struggling economy, and social unrest.The Prime Minister thanked his supporters after the vote, and promised to continue working for the country's development.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report that paints a bleak picture of our planet's future if we don't take immediate action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.According to the report, we can expect more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires as the planet continues to warm. These weather events will have devastating effects on communities around the world, particularly in areas that are already struggling with poverty and lack of resources.The report also warns of the impact on food production, as changing weather patterns and extreme weather events disrupt crop yields and make it more difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed the world's growing population.In addition to these environmental and humanitarian impacts, climate change will also have serious economic consequences. The report notes that we can expect increased damage to infrastructure, higher insurance costs, and reduced economic productivity as a result of extreme weather events.It's clear that urgent action is needed to address the threat of climate change. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We need to invest in renewable energy, promote energy efficiency, and change our consumption patterns to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.The impacts of climate change are coming sooner and faster than we thought, but it's not too late to take action.

In 2019, the Cuban government proposed a new constitution that included a provision that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman. However, this provision was ultimately removed after widespread public debate and criticism.Diaz-Canel's support for same-sex marriage comes at a time when LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly being recognized in Cuba. In recent years, there has been progress in the areas of employment discrimination, HIV/AIDS education, and transgender rights.However, there is still a long way to go in terms of full equality and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ community in Cuba.

According to Amnesty International, the government has been slow to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the crimes, leaving many victims and their families without redress.Amnesty International's Deputy Director for West and Central Africa, Kiné-Fatim Diop, stated that \"the Nigerian authorities' ongoing failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the horrific crimes committed by Boko Haram is leaving victims and their families feeling abandoned and helpless. The ICC must step in and take action to ensure that justice is done for these atrocities.\"The Boko Haram conflict, which began in 2009, has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions in Nigeria and neighboring countries. The militant group has been responsible for numerous attacks on civilians, including the 2014 abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria.The ICC is currently conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in Nigeria, but Amnesty International is calling for a full investigation into the Boko Haram conflict atrocities.

The results showed that a majority of students are feeling pessimistic about the future.When asked about their confidence in America's future, only 22% of students said they were \"very confident\". This is a significant decrease from just a few years ago, when the same survey found that 36% of students felt very confident about the future.The survey also showed that students are increasingly concerned about issues such as economic inequality, social justice, and climate change. Many students feel that these problems are not being adequately addressed by political leaders and institutions.Overall, the survey suggests that young people in America are feeling disillusioned and unsure about what lies ahead. While there are certainly reasons for concern, some experts say that this could also be an opportunity for positive change. By listening to young people and taking their concerns seriously, policymakers and leaders may be able to work towards a brighter future for all Americans.",

The nation was still in the midst of healing and recovery, and the results of the elections would have a major impact on the direction of the country.The elections were seen as a test of the popularity and effectiveness of President George W. Bush and his policies. The Republican Party, which held a slim majority in both houses of Congress, was hoping to maintain and potentially expand its power. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, was hoping to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq and other issues to gain seats and potentially take control of one or both houses of Congress.In the end, the Republicans were able to maintain their majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, their margin of control was reduced, with Democrats making gains in both chambers. The results were seen as a rebuke to President Bush and his policies, and a sign that the nation was growing more divided and skeptical of the Republican Party's agenda.The 2002 midterm elections set the stage for the contentious political climate of the following years. The country remained deeply divided over issues such as the war in Iraq, healthcare, and the economy.

He led the group during the final years of the conflict and signed the peace agreement with the Colombian government.Although Londoño's candidacy has been met with skepticism and criticism from some sectors of Colombian society, he argues that it is necessary to continue working towards the implementation of the peace agreement.\"We cannot go back to the war, we cannot let the peace process die. We have to move forward and ensure that the commitments made are fulfilled,\" Londoño said in his announcement.Londoño's campaign will focus on issues such as rural development, social justice, and human rights. He also plans to target corruption and promote a more equal distribution of wealth in the country.The upcoming presidential election in Colombia is expected to be highly contested, with a number of candidates vying for the position. However, Londoño's candidacy as a former guerrilla leader brings a unique perspective and set of experiences to the political arena.The success of Londoño's campaign remains uncertain, but his bid for the presidency highlights the ongoing challenges and complexities of the peace process in Colombia.",

The Chadians had been praised for their ability to operate in tough terrain and for their strong relationship with local communities.Many fear that the departure of the Chadian forces could lead to a power vacuum in the areas where they were stationed, which could be exploited by armed groups. There are also concerns that the withdrawal could lead to a spill-over of violence into neighboring countries, such as Chad and Sudan.The decision by Chad to withdraw its troops was reportedly prompted by a dispute with the CAR government over the use of Chadian forces to protect President Faustin-Archange Touadéra. The government had reportedly been insisting that the Chadians leave the country, leading to a breakdown in relations.The UN and other international organizations have called on all parties to work towards a peaceful solution to the crisis in the CAR, which has been wracked by violence and instability for years.

The 17-track CD is titled Lucky Dube ? The Best Of. It features all the hits that made the South African musician a household name across the continent, and abroad. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation.

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government.

Most students have left the area for safer places in the country’s interior.Cameroon education officials say violent raids and kidnappings by the Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram are taking their toll.Monouna Fotso with the Ministry of Secondary Education said regular cross-border attacks have virtually halted academic activity along Cameroon’s 500 kilometer boundary with Nigeria's Borno state, the stronghold of the militant group. Schools are a favorite target of Boko Haram, whose name means Western education is sin.\"The diagnosis is going on if there are some which are destroyed or occupied because some of the schools were temporarily occupied. I am telling you we are preoccupied, very preoccupied by this situation. It is the whole government, it is not only the Ministry of Secondary Education, that is preoccupied,\" said Fotso.Fotso said due to the insecurity, authorities have advised students and teachers to relocate.\"If there are some localities where the situation is so bad, at the level of the government, we will relocate some schools.

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources.

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers. “It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle,” said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.A pro-Russian man (not seen) holds a Russian flag behind an armed servicemen on top of a Russian army vehicle outside a Ukrainian border guard post in the Crimean town of Balaclava, March 1, 2014.Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich.

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital.

In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R. The announcement came amid public outrage after Chadian forces opened fire in Bangui's PK12 neighborhood on March 29.",

Seven major opposition parties organized Wednesday’s march at Pretoria’s Union Buildings, and said they will continue to loudly, and peacefully, protest Zuma for the duration of his term, which is set to end in 2019.South African President Jacob Zuma attends a commemoration for anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani in Boksburg, South Africa, April 10, 2017.\"Zuma is no longer a credible president of South Africa,\" far-left political leader Julius Malema told the ebullient crowd.The president has already earned many critics for a raft of long-simmering corruption scandals.
