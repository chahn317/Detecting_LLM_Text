He added that the party would not be bound by any specific ideology and would instead prioritize competence, efficiency, and innovation.Chahed served as Prime Minister of Tunisia from 2016 to 2020 and was a member of the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party before resigning and forming his own political entity. He faced criticism during his time in office for his handling of the economy and his response to social unrest, but he maintained strong support from some quarters.The announcement of Tayar Al-Machrek comes at a time of heightened political tension in Tunisia, with the country facing economic and social challenges and a divided political landscape.",

The collection, which included personal items such as glasses, a watch, and a wallet, had been expected to fetch around $2 million. The items were sold to an anonymous buyer by Christie's auction house in New York, with the proceeds going to fund a charitable foundation set up by Gandhi's family.The sale of the items had been closely watched by the Indian government, which had expressed concerns that the items could fall into the wrong hands and be used to foment unrest. Gandhi, who is revered in India as a symbol of nonviolent resistance, was assassinated in 1948. His belongings had been kept by his family members and were put up for auction for the first time.The auction was a significant moment for India, which had long claimed ownership of the items and had attempted to block their sale. However, a US court had ruled that the items were not stolen property, but rather the legitimate property of Gandhi's family, and could be sold.The sale of the items is expected to be a major boost for the charitable foundation set up by Gandhi's family, which supports a range of causes, including education and healthcare. The family has expressed its gratitude for the successful sale, and has pledged to continue its work in promoting the values of nonviolence and peace that Gandhi espoused.",

        "text": "Washington, DC - The US government has urged food processors to reduce the amount of salt in their products by one-third. The move is aimed at reducing the nation's salt intake, which is linked to a number of health problems, including high blood pressure and heart disease.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a target of reducing the average amount of salt consumed per day from 3,400 milligrams to 2,600 milligrams by 2025. The agency believes that this reduction is achievable and will have a significant impact on public health.According to the FDA, excessive salt consumption is a major contributor to the high rates of hypertension in the US. The agency estimates that reducing salt intake by 30% could prevent millions of cases of hypertension and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs.In response to the government's call to action, many food manufacturers have already begun reducing the amount of salt in their products. Some have developed low-sodium versions of popular foods, while others have reformulated their products to use alternative seasonings and flavorings.However, the FDA acknowledges that some foods are naturally high in salt and may require special processing or ingredient substitutions to reduce salt content. The agency is working with industry stakeholders to develop voluntary sodium reduction targets for these products.Despite the challenges, public health experts are hailing the government's initiative as a major step towards improving public health. The American Heart Association has praised the FDA for taking \"bold action\" to address the nation's salt consumption, and has called on other countries to follow the US's lead.In conclusion, the US government's call to action is a significant step towards reducing the country's salt intake and improving public health.",

Several candidates have accused Meehan of mistreating women and misusing his office, and the race is considered a test of the party's ability to capitalize on the #MeToo movement.Elsewhere in the state, Republicans are hoping to hold onto the 10th Congressional District, which covers parts of Harrisburg and Lancaster. Incumbent Scott Perry has been a reliable ally of President Donald Trump, and the district has a history of supporting Republican candidates. However, the Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, is a well-known political figure in the state and has been endorsed by several powerful unions.In the 11th Congressional District, which covers the Pittsburgh area, Republicans are also fighting to hold onto a seat that has been in their column for decades. Incumbent Jerry Kramer has faced criticism for his opposition to Obamacare and his support for the Trump tax plan, and his challenger, Democrat Erin McClelland, has been endorsed by several progressive groups.The Pennsylvania primaries are just one piece of a larger political puzzle that could have significant implications for the U.S. House of Representatives.

In these countries, MPs are often targeted by extremist groups or criminal organizations because of their position.The report also found that other professions, such as journalists, doctors, and aid workers, are also at high risk of violence in some countries.However, the report notes that there are significant differences in the levels of violence and instability across different regions and countries.For example, while being an MP may be one of the most dangerous professions in Africa and Asia, it is generally considered to be a safe profession in countries such as Canada and Sweden.The report concludes that political violence and instability are major challenges for many countries around the world, and that efforts should be made to improve security for MPs and other professionals at risk of violence.In some countries, such as Somalia and Afghanistan, this may require significant reforms to the political and security systems, the report says.Overall, the report provides a valuable insight into the challenges faced by MPs and other professionals in different parts of the world, and underscores the importance of improving security and reducing violence in these countries.",

The move comes less than a month after the central bank lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy.The RBI has raised the short-term lending rate, known as the repo rate, by 25 basis points to 6.75%. The move is aimed at bringing down inflation, which has been stubbornly high despite the central bank's efforts to cool it down.This is the second time in six months that the RBI has changed its stance on interest rates. In October, it lowered interest rates by 40 basis points to boost growth. However, inflation refused to come under control, remaining above the RBI's medium-term target of 4%.The latest interest rate hike is expected to put pressure on the central bank to raise rates further to curb inflation. Analysts say that the RBI may have to raise interest rates by as much as 100 basis points in the coming months to bring down inflation to acceptable levels.The move has been welcomed by investors, who see it as a positive sign for the Indian economy. However, it could also hurt growth by making borrowing more expensive for companies and consumers.The central bank's decision to raise interest rates is also expected to strengthen the Indian rupee, which has been under pressure due to a rise in crude oil prices and a widening current account deficit.The RBI has been grappling with high inflation, which has been driven by rising oil prices and supply chain disruptions.",

Classrooms are often overcrowded, with little space for students to learn and study. This makes it difficult for teachers to effectively teach and for students to learn.Another major problem facing West African schools is corruption. Many officials at the schools are misusing funds meant for the students and are instead lining their own pockets. This has led to a lack of resources for schools, including books, pencils and other necessary materials.The crisis in education in West Africa has reached a level of such dire proportions that the international community has taken notice. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has launched an emergency appeal for funds to help provide education for children in crisis areas of West Africa.In addition to the problems facing West African schools, the lack of funding has also led to a lack of trained teachers. This means that many students are not receiving the education they need to succeed in the future.The crisis in education in West Africa is a serious one, and it is imperative that something be done to address these issues.

The report also found that Germanwings, the airline involved in the crash, failed to detect Lubitz's problems despite having access to his medical records.In light of these findings, the BEA has recommended that airlines and regulatory authorities take steps to improve the monitoring and evaluation of pilots' mental and physical health. This includes regular medical checks, mental health screenings, and the creation of a European-wide database of pilots' medical records, which can be accessed by airlines and regulators.The recommendations have been welcomed by the aviation industry and regulatory authorities, who have agreed to work together to implement the necessary measures to improve the safety of air travel. However, some have questioned whether the proposed measures will be sufficient to prevent similar tragedies in the future.The Germanwings crash was a tragedy that shocked the world, and it is clear that steps must be taken to ensure that such a disaster never happens again.

The ICRC provides assistance to people affected by conflicts in places like Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Somalia, among others.The organization will also use the funds to step up its efforts to protect and assist civilians caught up in the fighting, including by providing medical care, shelter, and food.“The ICRC cannot solve these conflicts, but we can help alleviate the suffering of those caught up in them,” Maurer said.The ICRC has faced criticism in recent years for its decision to limit its operations in some areas due to security concerns. The organization has come under attack from armed groups in places like Syria and Yemen, and its staff have been killed or kidnapped.However, Maurer said the ICRC was committed to doing everything possible to assist people in need, despite the challenges and risks involved.“The ICRC's unwavering commitment to humanity is what sets us apart,” he said.",

The release of these child soldiers is seen as a positive step towards peace and stability in the young nation.In a statement, UNICEF Representative in South Sudan, Hamid El-Bashir, expressed his appreciation for the government's efforts in releasing the child soldiers and called for continued efforts to end the recruitment of children by armed groups.\"We hope that this will be a first step in a sustained effort to end the use of children by armed groups in South Sudan,\" El-Bashir said. \"The release of these children is a critical step towards ensuring their safety and well-being, and we urge all armed groups to follow suit.\"The release of the child soldiers comes at a time when the government of South Sudan and various armed groups are engaged in peace talks aimed at ending the conflict.",

The survey, which was conducted on a representative sample of over 4,000 US adults, found that 62% of respondents felt that drug users should receive treatment, while only 33% believed that they should be arrested and punished.The survey also found that there was a significant partisan divide on the issue, with 73% of Democrats believing that drug users should receive treatment, compared to 51% of Republicans. However, there was also a majority of Independents who supported treatment over jail time, with 59% agreeing with this view.The findings of the survey are in line with a growing movement towards treating drug addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue. Many experts argue that punitive approaches to drug use, such as imprisonment, are ineffective in addressing the root causes of addiction and often lead to further harm to individuals and communities.Instead, many advocate for a harm reduction approach that focuses on providing access to social and medical services, such as counseling, therapy, and clean needles, to help individuals overcome their addiction. This approach is supported by evidence from countries that have implemented such policies, which have seen a reduction in drug-related crime and an improvement in public health outcomes.In response to the survey findings, some experts have called on policymakers to prioritize investments in drug treatment and prevention programs, rather than relying on punitive measures to address drug use. They argue that this approach would not only benefit individuals struggling with addiction, but also contribute to safer and healthier communities overall.In conclusion, the Pew Research Center's survey results reflect a growing recognition of the need to address drug addiction as a health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue.",

The tribal system, which has been a fundamental part of Yemeni society for centuries, is now contributing to the deepening conflict in the country.Yemen is divided into various tribal confederations, each with its own traditions, customs, and laws. These tribes have long maintained their own autonomous governance, which has led to a lack of centralized authority and government control over certain regions of the country.The current conflict in Yemen has further exacerbated the divisions between the different tribes. The conflict began in 2015, when the Houthi rebellion, backed by Iran, took control of much of the country, including the capital, Sana'a. Since then, the country has been divided between the government forces, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and the Houthi rebels.The conflict has created a power vacuum in many parts of the country, which has been filled by tribal leaders. These leaders have used their influence and power to further their own interests, often at the expense of the broader population. The lack of a strong central government has only strengthened the position of these tribal leaders, and has made it more difficult for the government to maintain control.The tribal system has also made it more difficult for humanitarian organizations to operate in the country. Humanitarian workers have been subject to kidnapping and other forms of violence, and many of the areas they need to access are controlled by tribal leaders who may not be sympathetic to their cause.The situation in Yemen is complex and multifaceted, but the tribal system is undoubtedly a contributing factor to the deepening conflict. The international community has been working to bring an end to the conflict, but it will likely require a long-term solution that addresses the underlying issues of tribalism and governance in Yemen.",

In fact, there have been several periods in American history when the economy has performed better, such as in the 1960s.2. Trump also claimed that his administration has created 7 million jobs. While it is true that the economy has added jobs during Trump's presidency, the President's number is an exaggeration. The actual number of jobs created is closer to 2 million.3. The President also claimed that he has cut regulations more than any other President in history. While it is true that the Trump Administration has rolled back many regulations, this claim is not supported by data. In fact, the Obama Administration was the most active in terms of creating regulations, while the Trump Administration has actually increased the number of regulations.4. Trump also claimed that his administration has achieved the \"greatest progress in the history of our country\" in terms of addressing the opioid crisis. While it is true that the Administration has taken some steps to address the crisis, this claim is misleading. In reality, the opioid crisis continues to be a major problem in the United States and has not been effectively addressed.5. Finally, the President claimed that his Administration has \"started the construction of a wall on the southern border\". While it is true that some construction of the wall has taken place, the claim that it has been \"started\" is misleading.

The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said that the US was keen to engage in a constructive dialogue with Beijing in order to address its concerns about the THAAD system.The THAAD system is a US-made missile defense system that is capable of shooting down ballistic missiles in mid-flight. The system has been deployed in South Korea for several years, but it has also been the subject of criticism from China, which has expressed concerns that it could compromise its own national security.The US official said that the dialogue with China would aim to address those concerns and to ensure that the THAAD system was not a threat to the security of the region. The official added that the US was committed to working with its allies in the region to maintain stability and security in the face of North Korean threats.The news of the US-China dialogue on THAAD came as tensions between the two countries continue to escalate over a range of issues, including trade and human rights. However, the official said that the THAAD dialogue was a separate issue and that it was not intended to be a bargaining chip in broader negotiations between the two countries.The THAAD system has been a flashpoint in US-China relations in recent years, and the decision to engage in dialogue with Beijing is likely to be welcomed by many in the region who are concerned about the escalating tensions between the two countries.While the exact details of the dialogue have yet to be worked out, the US official said that the US was committed to finding a resolution that would be acceptable to all parties involved.",

The bloc has faced challenges in fostering a culture of democracy, particularly in countries like Myanmar and Cambodia where authoritarian regimes have been entrenched for decades.However, with Thailand serving as the host of the upcoming ASEAN Summit, analysts are looking to the country as a potential catalyst for democratic progress in the region. Thailand has a history of democratic governance, with the country enjoying over a decade of elected civilian governments before the military seized power in a 2014 coup.Since then, Thailand has faced a tumultuous political landscape, with the military-backed government facing criticism for its human rights record and suppression of dissent. The country's democratic process has been hindered by legal challenges, boycotts, and election delays, leading some to question whether the country will be able to hold a fair and free election in the near future.Despite these challenges, analysts say that the success of the ASEAN Summit in Thailand could signal a turning point for democracy in the region. The summit provides an opportunity for the country to showcase its commitment to democracy and its ability to host a successful international event.If the summit is deemed a success, it could provide a boost to Thailand's democratic process and encourage other ASEAN countries to follow suit.",

The incident has been described as one of the most baffling aviation mysteries in recent history.The cause of the crash remains unknown, and investigators are still piecing together the events leading up to the tragedy. US officials have urged caution and patience as they continue to search for answers.The disappearance of MH370 has also raised concerns about airline safety and the need for improved tracking and communication systems in the aviation industry.",

This will have devastating effects on communities and infrastructure around the world.The report also highlights the potential for sea-level rise, which could displace millions of people and cause extensive damage to coastal cities and ecosystems.These are just a few examples of the numerous and severe impacts of climate change that the IPCC report warns us about. It is clear that we must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality.",

The country has had a number of openly gay and transgender politicians, and it has also decriminalized homosexuality.However, same-sex marriage is not yet legal in Cuba. The country's current laws do not recognize same-sex unions, and same-sex couples do not have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.Díaz-Canel's announcement is being hailed as a major step forward for LGBT rights in Cuba. Many hope that this will lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country, and that it will also lead to increased recognition and protection of the rights of LGBT individuals.Cuba is not the only country in the region to be taking steps towards legalizing same-sex marriage.",

This decision, which comes after years of diplomatic efforts and negotiations, is seen as a significant step towards promoting peace and stability in the Southeast Asian nation.President Barack Obama made the announcement in a statement released by the White House on Tuesday, stating that the move was made in response to Burma's ongoing democratic reforms and its commitment to peaceful reconciliation.According to the President, the suspension of sanctions will not only improve the lives of the people of Burma, but will also strengthen the country's ties with the United States and the international community.The economic sanctions on Burma had been in place since 1988, following the military coup that brought the current military junta to power. The move had been widely criticized by the international community, with many calling for an end to the sanctions in order to promote a peaceful and prosperous Burma.The announcement has been welcomed by political leaders and human rights activists alike, who see it as a significant step towards promoting democracy and human rights in the Southeast Asian nation. The suspension of sanctions is also seen as a positive sign for the country's ongoing peace talks with various ethnic armed groups.While the suspension of sanctions is seen as a positive step, it is also being viewed with caution by some who fear that it may compromise the US's ability to influence events in Burma. However, the White House has made it clear that the move does not signal a complete lifting of sanctions, and that the US will continue to monitor Burma's progress closely.The United States is not the only country to have imposed economic sanctions on Burma.

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader.

The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him.

The 17-track CD is titled Lucky Dube ? The Best Of. It features all the hits that made the South African musician a household name across the continent, and abroad. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy?

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says.

Over 19,000 children are thought to have been recruited by all sides.The \"laying down of the guns\" ceremony for 87 girls and 224 boys was the first step in a process that should see at least 700 child soldiers freed in the coming weeks, the United Nations said.Putting down weapons and rejoining normal life is just the \"beginning of the journey,\" said the head of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, David Shearer.The U.N. has released almost 2,000 child soldiers so far. More than 10 percent of them have been under age 13.Human rights groups say child recruitment continues, even as South Sudan's government says it has committed to ending the practice.\"The continued recruitment and use of children by the military and opposing armed groups points to the utter impunity that reigns in South Sudan, and the terrible cost of this war on children,\" Mausi Segun, Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a new report this week.One 17-year-old who had been abducted and forced to fight attended Wednesday's ceremony while clasping his arms around his stomach and staring at the ground. He gave only his first name, Christopher.\"They told me to kill my mother,\" he said, his voice barely audible.After being seized from his home by opposition soldiers at the age of 10 during a period of localized fighting, he said his mother came into the bush to plead with his commanders to set him free.\"When she came they told me to shoot her or I'd be killed instead,\" the boy said.",

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

The United States wants to do everything we can to be sure that is the reality,\" she said.Secretary Clinton praised the parliamentary elections that brought Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition party to parliament, but said some U.S. measures, including an arms embargo, will remain in place until the country's reforms are complete.In a video conference via Skype, hosted by former U.S. president George W. Bush, Aung San Suu Kyi said the suspension of U.S. sanctions against Burma, rather than their full removal, will keep the pressure on the military to stay on track with political reforms. \"I sometimes feel that things, that people are too optimistic about the scene in Burma. You have to remember that the democratization process is not irreversible. I have said very openly that we can never look upon it as irreversible until such time as the military commits itself to democratization,\" she said.With abundant natural resources, Burma is ripe for new business.",

While the political channel is progressing well and we wish President Karzai all success, the process of rebuilding the Afghan national army and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan needs to be accelerated to install durable peace in Afghanistan.\"Mr.",

However, conditions for the elections, originally scheduled for October, remain imperfect. The poll has been marred by widespread logistical problems, claims of vote-rigging, the post-election period might also be difficult to manage. Expectations were high in Bangui ahead of Wednesday’s vote. Outside one polling station in the neighborhood of Castor, near the city center, impatient voters hoping to turn a page on the country’s three-year long conflict lined up before dawn.Jean-Philipe Dora, a lawyer, said the population was ready for change.Dora said over the last three years life has been suspended. People live in poverty. He said that is why we have to choose the right leader, someone who can reconcile and reunite the country and bring hope to the population.

        "text": "BANGUI - Many people in the Central African Republic are welcoming Chad's decision to withdraw its troops from the African Union peacekeeping force in the country. However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R. The announcement came amid public outrage after Chadian forces opened fire in Bangui's PK12 neighborhood on March 29.",

Tens of thousands of South Africans donned bright colors and marched to his official residence in central Pretoria, singing and dancing as they made their way through the streets.But they were not bringing birthday wishes.Instead, tens of thousands of South Africans massed on the president’s front lawn to ask the increasingly unpopular leader to leave office.
