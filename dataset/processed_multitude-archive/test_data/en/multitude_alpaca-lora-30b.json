The survey, conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, shows that only 19% of students believe the US will be more prosperous in the next 50 years, a significant decline from last year's number of 29%. The study also showed that the number of students who feel the US has an obligation to act as a global leader dropped from 64% last year to 55% this year, and the number of students who believe the US is the greatest country in the world decreased from 80% to 63%. In addition, the study discovered that only 51% of students believed that America's government treats citizens equally, and only 37% agreed that America is a strong and safe nation. The survey also found that 74% of students think that their generation will be worse off than their parents.

The birds are known to fly in large groups at high speeds, which can lead to collisions with aircrafts in the area. Despite the findings, officials from the Federal Aviation Administration are refusing to publicly declare the accident a case of bird strike.According to some aviation experts, bird strikes are fairly common and can sometimes be dangerous. But officials from the FAA insist that these events are rarely fatal, and that the odds of a bird strike leading to a crash are very slim.A National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the crash has begun and will take several weeks to complete.

With new styles and designs always popping up, it is becoming increasingly difficult for designers and fashion brands to keep up with the trends. But now, thanks to technology, they can create pieces that stand out and keep up with the latest fashion trends. Digital manufacturing, artificial intelligence and 3D printing are leading the way for innovative fashion designs, and they're also allowing designers to create unique and customized pieces on a mass scale. Artificial intelligence is taking over the fashion industry, as it provides designers the ability to predict fashion trends, create designs, and even suggest items from a customer’s past purchases. In addition, the rise of smart fabrics is allowing for fashion pieces that can be integrated with technology, such as fabrics that can display images, collect and store information, and even respond to the wearer’s environment. This will allow consumers to get the latest tech-enhanced fashion designs and even create their own unique fashion pieces. Technology is clearly redefining the fashion industry, and it shows no signs of slowing down. With more innovations in technology, fashion will continue to be reshaped by technology for the better. ### Input:You are a marketing consultant.

Its GDP has risen almost sevenfold since 1978 and its per capita income is 20 times higher.China has made remarkable progress in the spheres of health, education, infrastructure and science, too. The nation has managed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. It has also made breakthroughs in areas such as technology and space exploration.Economic reform has been an integral part of China's success. Since 1978, it has introduced new economic policies such as privatization of land and state-owned enterprises, and reform of the taxation system. These policies have enabled China to transition from a planned economy to a market economy and further increased the nation's wealth.China's social security system has also made significant strides. It has expanded the scope of welfare insurance and built up an extensive medical and healthcare network. The government has implemented policies that are aimed at improving the quality of life of the nation's population.China's political system has also evolved over the years. Although the ruling Communist Party has not moved away from its one-party system, it has introduced significant reforms, such as term limits for the President. It has also made efforts to make its political system more open, transparent, and accountable.In conclusion, China's achievements over the past 60 years have been remarkable. From a once poor nation, it has become one of the world's leading economies.",

Many of the protesters carried signs opposing the use of Chinese mainland as the sole language for official business. Protesters also called for more transparency in government decisions.The protests were led by opposition parties as well as members of the general public, with organizers reporting an attendance of over 10,000 people. Demonstrators marched from the central railway station to the presidential offices, stopping briefly at the city hall to demand that the president and her cabinet should resign. The government of Taiwan, which claims to be the legitimate government of mainland China, has been criticized by opposition parties for its pro-Beijing policies. In January, President Tsai Ing-wen announced plans to strengthen relations between the two countries, including greater cooperation on tourism, transportation, and trade. The move was seen as a concession to mainland China, which has claimed Taiwan as its own for decades. In response, pro-independence opposition parties have called on the government to focus more on the interests of its citizens and have accused Beijing of coercion.The protest was largely peaceful, though police reported some minor scuffles and some arrests were made. Protesters have said that they will continue to mobilize until the government changes its policies and rescinds the pro-Beijing policies.",

Pompeo told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday that the US and its allies had a responsibility to defend themselves and the region against the growing threat from North Korea, and added that dialogue was important to manage US-China relations, particularly concerning THAAD. The US, South Korea, and Japan agreed last year to deploy THAAD, an anti-missile system, to the Korean Peninsula to counter North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes. China has consistently expressed its opposition to THAAD, and has accused South Korea of destabilising the regional security balance.

Meanwhile, Beijing has expressed hopes that Washington will take into consideration its security interests when making decisions on sensitive issues such as the deployment of THAAD. \"We hope that the US will take into consideration China's legitimate concerns, earnestly respect China's security interests, and properly handle the relevant issue,” China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said on Thursday.",

The Occupy Movement is hoping to reach out to a much wider audience than before and raise their voice for greater social and economic justice. They are looking to gain support for a more equitable financial system, where the wealth is distributed more evenly and the 1% are held accountable for the injustices they've committed.

This material is able to stretch and move, making the hand more flexible than previous versions of robotic hands. This lightweight and cheaper design is expected to be useful for a wide range of purposes, from manufacturing to rehabilitation.The robotic hand is made up of a series of interconnected plastic parts that each have a specific task. This allows for more flexibility than traditional robotic hands, which are usually made of metals and are costly to produce. The team of researchers has experimented with different materials and techniques, and have chosen to use a silicon-based polymer that can be 3D printed in complex shapes and patterns to produce a lightweight, flexible hand.This new robotic hand can be adapted to different tasks and environments, meaning it has a wide range of applications. These include industrial automation, prosthetic hands and rehabilitation, as well as being used for educational purposes in classrooms. With its cheap and flexible design, the new robotic hand has the potential to change the way we use robots for various purposes.",

This article fact-checks several of the claims Trump made, with a particular focus on the data and statistics he cited. Firstly, Trump claimed that \"our economy is the envy of the world, setting records, and has never been stronger.\"The claim that the US economy is the envy of the world is, quite simply, wrong. While the US has posted solid growth in recent years, other countries have shown stronger economic performance. France, for example, is currently enjoying the strongest economic growth in Europe, with GDP increasing 2.3% in the third quarter of 2019. Secondly, Trump claimed that \"wages are rising at the fastest rate in decades\" and that \"unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.\"While it is true that unemployment rates in the US are at historic lows, wage growth is not increasing at the rate Trump claimed. Average hourly earnings for US workers have risen by only 3.1% since January 2019, which is below the rate of inflation. Finally, Trump claimed that \"for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\"This is incorrect. The US became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 2017, not 2020. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the US was a net exporter of energy in 2017, 2018, and the first half of 2019, but was a net importer in the second half of 2019. As this article shows, President Trump’s State of the Union address relied on inaccurate claims about the US economy.",

In a new report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) called for improvements to the EPA's inspection and enforcement of state compliance with federal rules that govern safe drinking water. Flint's water supply became contaminated in April 2014, when the state switched water supplies for the city, which led to corrosive and toxic water coming out of tap. The EPA has been criticized for failing to notify the public of the water’s dangerous levels of lead and for not acting quickly to rectify the problem. The GAO said the EPA must work to establish a clear process for investigating and resolving drinking water complaints from the public. It also recommended the agency take steps to improve compliance data collection and ensure that state officials carry out regular lead and copper sampling tests as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Flint water crisis has exposed widespread problems in the U.S. water infrastructure. This report underscores the need for better coordination and communication between state and federal authorities and for greater vigilance in ensuring the safety of drinking water for all Americans.",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him.

Police wanted the demonstrators to move to their original protest grounds, Dewey Square, where the protesters have set up a tent city.Police had warned that protesters who did not obey police orders would be arrested on charges of unlawful assembly and trespassing.Many of the protesters arrested Tuesday are affiliated with the Occupy Boston group, which is an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York last month.Occupy Wall Street is a loosely organized, grass-roots movement that has held protests and sit-ins in various American cities. Demonstrators protest a variety of issues, including corporate greed and economic inequality.

The 17-track CD is titled Lucky Dube ? The Best Of. It features all the hits that made the South African musician a household name across the continent, and abroad. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately.

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government.

Most students have left the area for safer places in the country’s interior.Cameroon education officials say violent raids and kidnappings by the Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram are taking their toll.Monouna Fotso with the Ministry of Secondary Education said regular cross-border attacks have virtually halted academic activity along Cameroon’s 500 kilometer boundary with Nigeria's Borno state, the stronghold of the militant group. Schools are a favorite target of Boko Haram, whose name means Western education is sin.\"The diagnosis is going on if there are some which are destroyed or occupied because some of the schools were temporarily occupied. I am telling you we are preoccupied, very preoccupied by this situation. It is the whole government, it is not only the Ministry of Secondary Education, that is preoccupied,\" said Fotso.Fotso said due to the insecurity, authorities have advised students and teachers to relocate.\"If there are some localities where the situation is so bad, at the level of the government, we will relocate some schools. At that moment also, we will bring the staff and students to new sites. The objective of this Boko Haram is to traumatize our citizens,\" Fotso said.The border areas which have been hardest hit are Amchide, Fotocol, Kolofata and Kiti Matari.",

And, there have been cases of contractor abuse ranging from violence to cultural insensitivity that have given the private security industry a bad name among many Afghans.Karzai set this month as the deadline for private security firms to be replaced with the interior ministry's new Afghan Private Protection Force or APPF. That deadline has been extended for up to 90 days to facilitate the transition. But more than 50 private security companies will be dissolved and more than 10,000 security guards will be re-assigned or replaced.Brigadier General Carsten Jacobson, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, says this is an important milestone in the process of transferring all security responsibilities to Afghan forces before most international combats troops withdraw in 2014. ?The APPF is focusing now on taking over security responsibility for development projects, convoys and commercial businesses,\" said Jacobson. \"By March 2013 all security for ISAF bases and construction sites are scheduled to transition to the APPF.?Of course the service is not free.

Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality.

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

The winner becomes prime minister due to the LDP-led coalition's grip on parliament.\"It is my responsibility to respond to the mandate of the people,\" Abe told reporters during a trip to southwestern Japan.\"I am resolved to steer Japan for another three years as LDP president and prime minister.\"Analysts say Abe looks set hold on to the top job because his nearly six years in power have enabled him to woo LDP backers with cabinet posts and other favors and to shut out rivals, while a weak opposition makes his lukewarm popularity among the electorate less relevant.Abe began a second stint as prime minister in 2012 promising to reboot the deflation-plagued economy with his \"Abenomics\" policies and to bolster defense.He has boosted defense spending and loosened constitutional limits on the military but, on the economic side, the Bank of Japan has failed to reach its 2 percent inflation target despite an ultra-loose policy.What Abe will pursue if he wins the vote and extends his tenure as prime minister is far from clear.\"What is the economic agenda?",

The vast majority of the outgoing European Parliament, which votes on EU laws and has a say in the bloc's policies, is also white. The new assembly, serving from 2019-24, will be only slightly more diverse.The number of black women in the assembly is expected to increase to six from just one in the last mandate, Chander said.Representation of Europe's biggest minority, the Roma, has dropped, however. Only three Roma members were elected last month while five served in the last mandate.",

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources.

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers. “It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle,” said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.A pro-Russian man (not seen) holds a Russian flag behind an armed servicemen on top of a Russian army vehicle outside a Ukrainian border guard post in the Crimean town of Balaclava, March 1, 2014.Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich. But for the authorities in Kiev and local politicians still loyal to Ukraine, the rapid pace of events were evidence of a carefully orchestrated campaign from Moscow. Moscow denies any role in installing Aksyonov, who is known from his business days by the nickname “The Goblin”. But even those close to the Kremlin say Russia picked him. “Moscow always bet on Yanukovich. But after the coup in Kiev on Feb. 22 ...

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country.
