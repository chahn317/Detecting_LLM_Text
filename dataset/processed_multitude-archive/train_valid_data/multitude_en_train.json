Residents have been forced to fetch their water from alternative sources, such as nearby rivers and streams.The shortage has been linked to the recent dry spell in the region, as well as the age of the city's infrastructure. Many of the city's pipes are over 70 years old, and many of the water mains need urgent repairs or replacements.In response, the government has launched an emergency plan to address the shortage. This includes upgrading and repairing old infrastructure, as well as constructing new storage tanks to supplement existing supplies.Residents, meanwhile, are taking matters into their own hands by drilling shallow wells and installing private pumps. Some local businesses have also stepped in to provide water to those most affected.The water shortage has also had a significant impact on the city's economy. With shops, restaurants and hotels facing closures, local businesses have seen a decrease in their income.In spite of the government's efforts, residents fear that the water shortage will become an ongoing issue. The government is currently working on a long-term solution to address the city's water needs. In the meantime, residents have been encouraged to conserve water as much as possible.",

The new constitution, which was voted on late last week, gives the president the power to appoint key officials without the approval of the parliament, as well as the ability to dissolve the legislature and call for new elections. Opposition parties have argued that this concentration of power in the hands of the president could lead to authoritarianism and undermine the democratic process. However, supporters of the new constitution argue that it will provide stability and efficiency in governance. It is now up to the Chadian people to decide whether to approve the new constitution in a referendum to be held next month.",

The 65-year-old leader assumed office after taking an oath of loyalty to the Russian Constitution, committing himself to serve the people. The swearing-in marked the start of another six-year presidential term for Putin, a former KGB officer who has been in power since 2000.Putin's inauguration comes amid a wave of controversy sparked by a controversial election in March 2018. A series of large-scale anti-government protests broke out in Russia following the election, leading to clashes with police and the detention of hundreds of protesters.The Russian leader has come under fire from his critics for failing to address the issues that sparked the protests, such as endemic corruption and declining standards of living. His inauguration has also been the target of widespread criticism from the international community due to the repression of protesters and widespread reports of vote-rigging.Despite the controversy, Putin's supporters continue to back the president, who they regard as a guarantor of stability and order in Russia. While this support may not be enough to quell all of the criticism, it is clear that Putin will continue to serve as the leader of Russia for the foreseeable future.",

Meanwhile, Killer Mike joined the duo for a performance of \"The Whole World\", a collaboration from their 2001 greatest hits album, \"Big Boi and Dre Present...Outkast\".The duo's undeniable chemistry was evident throughout the night, with Big Boi's slick flow perfectly complementing Andre 3000's eclectic style. The pair joked around and played off each other, proving that time apart had not diminished the bond that first brought them together in the early 1990s.As the night drew to a close, Outkast gave a heartfelt performance of \"The Way You Move\", with the massive crowd singing along to the chorus. The duo then thanked their fans for supporting them throughout their long and illustrious career, promising that they would \"see them soon\".The Coachella reunion was the first stop of Outkast's 20th-anniversary tour, which will see them performing at over 40 festivals worldwide.

And the United States military says car bombs are still the main reason for the uptick in murders in Iraq, a key reason why the U.S. military's withdrawal is being delayed until next spring.U.S. military spokesman Major General Donald Bolduc said attacks using cars are also what are causing the most casualties, saying the main method of attack is on motor vehicles.U.S. Army Brigadier General William Marks agreed with that assessment. \"It's a pretty significant increase. And you can see, it's because of attacks on convoys in Baghdad.\"Marks says the Iraqis have been successful in stopping attacks on the roads, but now, terrorists are turning to the neighborhoods for their attacks. Marks says he doesn't know how it could be any worse.Bolduc acknowledged there have been increases in civilian deaths since March, but he said they were from the normal violence of the past four years and were not part of a systematic campaign of sectarian killings. \"We have not seen any increase of sectarian violence, sectarian based, so we are pleased with the trend there. Of course, there are more than four hundred thousand civilians who live in Baghdad so there are going to be occasional problems.\"The United Nations says the number of civilians killed in Baghdad in January and February rose more than one thousand percent from the same months of last year. The UN says that in just over two months, some 446 Iraqis died in bomb attacks.Bolduc said those who claimed a systematic campaign of violence did not pay attention to the facts. \"We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of different incidents that are being dealt with. And the investigations have revealed that there is not some type of large campaign to kill all Iraqi Shi'ites or any particular sect for that matter.\"In any case, the United Nations says the rate of civilian deaths has dropped in the months since February.",

Proponents of the decision praised the President for his efforts in nuclear arms reduction, increased diplomatic efforts to resolve international disputes, and his commitment to international aid and development.The decision also sparked criticism, however. Opponents of the move argued that such a prestigious award should not be given to a sitting president, especially one who has had a controversial term in office, and that the Nobel committee had succumbed to political pressure. The fact that Obama is the first sitting U.S. president to accept the award has also caused a stir in the international community, as the U.S. is often criticized for its foreign policy decisions and actions. The announcement of the award has put a spotlight on the President and his efforts for peace and diplomacy, as well as reignited a discussion of whether or not he is worthy of such a prestigious honor.

The analysis is by the women and pay group Women’s Budget Trust (WBT), which looked at the Government’s public sector pensions (PSP) data.According to the analysis, if all women in the civil service were receiving the same pension rate as men it would increase the income of the population by £37.7 billion in today’s money.However, women in the public sector earn less than men. WBT found women in the public sector earn 7.2 per cent less, on average, than men.The report highlighted the Government’s “insufficient” action to close the gender pay gap, including by ensuring that women in the public service received the same pension rate as men.If the Government does not take action to “stabilise the system”, it could see women in the public sector make up the difference that could be made up by increasing the public sector pension and incentivising work.The research showed that in 2017-18 the total amount of pensionable women in the public sector reached £44.2 billion, compared to £43.8 billion for men.If the Government increased the level of the public sector pension and the same pensionable women were given the same level of pension as men they would see a total saving of £35.4 billion (not adjusted for inflation).However, the research also showed that in 2016-17, women in the public sector were receiving an “inadequate” pension.That in itself is cause for concern given that in 2010-11 the public sector pension was £22,100 per year and for men £21,000.According to WBT, the Government has shown “no willingness to take action to level the playing field or stabilise the system”.It added that the fact that women in the public sector are only receiving a pension rate lower than men is “unacceptable”.",

The project is focused on creating economic prosperity in a country that has no economic growth to speak of. But the country is also currently experiencing a food shortage.WFP has been reporting on this story for a very long time. There is now widespread famine and there is a huge risk of starvation in a country where 90 per cent of the population lives below the world’s humanitarian threshold. But there’s nothing that could have been predicted that would have happened during this period.WFP has been predicting a major famine since 2015. On August 12, in what was a major development, WFP declared Yemen a famine country. On the same day, I saw on Facebook that it was reported that there were 100,000 new cases of acute malnutrition in the country.There has been no serious government effort to fight this major famine which is ravaging Yemen. The population of Yemen is largely dependent on its agriculture. It is a poor country but has a big supply of agriculture so it has been able to make a relatively small number of farmers out of the people of Yemen. This is a major source of food security and food in the country. The situation is likely to become more and more catastrophic if not fixed immediately.What WFP needs is the leadership of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is heavily dependent on Yemen’s agriculture and has a huge number of troops and weapons in the country.The Saudis need to make a decision and move on from a military support role for the Government of Yemen. If it is truly the case that Saudi Arabia is helping it to fight the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps then perhaps this is the time to start moving forward.",

They claimed that he had created a \"culture of deceit\" within his company, and that his actions had caused significant financial losses to investors.The trial attracted significant media attention, with many commentators discussing the broader implications of the case for the finance industry as a whole.

The world is now suffering from an unprecedented level of downtime for various services on the Internet.The outage began at 9:45 a.m. on Friday morning and it continues. Users are being directed towards various websites and search engines, and the major news networks have been largely unable to get their stories.People are complaining about the outage on Twitter and even on YouTube. Some are tweeting the hashtag #FireStormDown, which is aimed at letting people know about the outage.“This is a crazy #FireStormDown. We’re all stuck at home. We’ll be out soon but I’m not sure when exactly.” said one Twitter user.“Just waiting on Netflix to stop buffering. Not sure why they can’t get it to work,” said another user.“#FireStormDown #FDR” said one user.The outage is the worst the Internet has experienced so far. The longest Internet outage was on January 10th, 2006 when it lasted for 8 days and 1 hour.So many people have complained about the outage that Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook have all been affected.Many people are concerned that they won’t be able to get their Netflix, Hulu, or Youtube account down.One user is blaming the outage on Amazon Web Services.“My Netflix and Hulu is completely down. If you look at my Amazon Web Services account… it’s down too.” said the user.Others are blaming the outage on Comcast and AT&T.Another user told Wired about the problem with the Internet.“The Internet is down. So much for the hype. The cable industry, and in general, is all about keeping the Internet down. Comcast and AT&T and their ilk have a big, big business model built around the continued, almost continuous down time. This is the way they keep their oligopoly going.”Another user told Wired of the outage.“I’ve been in the game for 20 years. I am absolutely 100 percent convinced that our current system of Internet access would not exist if not for the enormous investments made in Internet networks and infrastructure over the last 30 years or so.",

The speaker is elected by secret ballot in a process where parliamentarians are given three ballots. One to vote for themselves, one to vote for the person they want to be the speaker and one to keep as a second vote in case the person they want doesn't receive enough votes in the first round.The vote was contested when a candidate for the position of speaker emerged after the first round. It is thought the Islamist group al-Shabab could be behind this as they have stated they do not recognise the new parliament's legitimacy. Some parliamentarians, who did not support the Islamist candidate who was chosen, were expelled from the parliament by the militia. This has led to the election of the speaker and two deputy speakers being suspended.Somalia is still recovering from two decades of conflict, including attacks by the al-Qaeda aligned al-Shabab and the intervention of African Union forces. The new parliament needs to be able to unite this deeply divided country in order to rebuild, but the militia's actions undermine the government's power in this.",

Many are sexually assaulted by their superiors while in service and face immense stigma and marginalization when they return home. This is pushing these girls to re-enter militias in search of safety and security.“It’s sad to see that many of the women who have gone through terrible experiences in the military are now again joining the very same groups that abused them in the first place,” said Valentine Kitagwa of the International Rescue Committee.An estimated 30,000 women and girls have been enrolled in the DRC’s armed forces since 1998. Many are preyed upon by the military’s leadership and experience sexual violence before fleeing the army. Once they leave, these former soldiers are often abandoned by their families and rejected by the communities they left behind, creating an even bigger challenge to their survival.“These women have experienced tremendous harm in their country’s armed forces and now they’re rejected by their families and the community,” said Cynthia Mpaka, DRC gender-based violence coordinator for the United Nations Population Fund.The DRC government has done little to address the plight of former girl soldiers and support their reintegration into society. No funding has been allocated to track their whereabouts or provide medical and psychological care.“The government must work to identify these women, provide support to those who want to reintegrate and ensure they are not victimized again,” said Kitagwa.Until the government takes the necessary steps to protect and provide support for former girl soldiers, they will continue to be vulnerable and exposed to further violence.",

In Indonesia, it is prohibited for children aged below 17 years old to work.The head of the KPU East Java branch, Prijanto, confirmed on Saturday that his department is working to establish a policy which would punish those candidates who involve children in their election campaigns.There have been previous instances of candidates employing children to act as campaigners and flag carriers. The main reason for this is the children’s willingness to work for very little. This is particularly attractive for a candidate who has limited funding. A campaigner hired to drive a campaign truck will expect to receive 200,000 Rupiah per day. The same work can be performed for a fraction of the cost by using children.East Java authorities have come down hard on those candidates who have attempted to employ children for their political campaign.",

The aim is to ensure that troops are ready for the upcoming battle, in which they will be pitted against some of the world's most experienced and ruthless fighters.The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been working closely with the United States and other coalition partners in recent months, receiving both training and equipment to bolster their capabilities. According to a statement by the US-led coalition, this training has focused on a range of areas including \"urban warfare, building clearing, and tactical movement\".The increased training comes as the SDF moves closer to the outskirts of Raqqa, with many expecting an assault on the city to begin in the coming weeks. The operation is expected to be a major test for both the SDF and its coalition partners, with estimates suggesting that up to 4,000 IS fighters could be defending the city.The battle for Raqqa is seen as a crucial one in the fight against IS, with the city serving as the group's de-facto capital in Syria. Recent months have seen the US-led coalition step up its efforts to dislodge the group from the city, with heavy airstrikes targeting IS positions around the clock.Despite this, the situation in Syria remains incredibly complex, with numerous groups fighting for control of territory across the country. The SDF, which is primarily made up of Kurdish fighters, has been criticized by some for its alleged links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist organization by both Turkey and the United States.Regardless of these issues, the SDF remains a key partner for the United States in the fight against IS, with the upcoming offensive on Raqqa set to be a major test of their abilities. As the group continues its training efforts, the eyes of the world will be on Syria, waiting to see how the battle for Raqqa unfolds.",

Reeve, a longtime advocate for stem cell research, said that the cloning technique could hold the key to curing a host of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and spinal cord injuries. The technique involves creating stem cells that are a genetic match for a patient, which can then be used to treat various ailments. The US Congress, however, has banned all forms of human cloning since 1998, including therapeutic cloning. Reeve called on Congress to lift the ban and allow scientists to pursue the potential benefits of therapeutic cloning, saying that it was a matter of \"life and death\" for millions of people. His comments came during a news conference in Washington, D.C., where he was attending a Senate hearing on the topic. Reeve's plea was echoed by several scientists who testified at the hearing, who argued that the ban was hindering the progress of medical research. However, opponents of therapeutic cloning argue that it is unethical and immoral to create embryos for the sole purpose of harvesting stem cells.

Families accounted for about one-third of people who were stopped at the border.He called the increase “a direct response to gaps in the legal framework,” adding, “we’re not surprised by it, but it’s been a very stark trend.”The numbers offer a glimpse into the impact of the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy on illegal crossings introduced in April, which resulted in the separation of more than 2,500 children from their parents. President Donald Trump effectively ended the practice of separating families in June amid heavy criticism.The statistics also come as the midterm elections are approaching and immigration remains a key issue in campaigns across the country. McAleenan, a Trump appointee, called the situation “a crisis of significant proportions from a humanitarian perspective and a security perspective.”Overall, people arrested or stopped at the border totaled 46,560, up from 39,953 in July and 30,567 in August 2017.",

He believes that this will help to create a more peaceful and stable world.According to Yunus, poverty is not just an individual problem, but a systemic issue that requires a collective effort to solve. He has called for governments and organizations to work together to reduce inequality and promote economic growth in poorer communities.The Bangladeshi economist also highlighted the importance of education and job opportunities in reducing poverty and promoting peace. He believes that providing people with the tools and skills they need to improve their economic situation will go a long way towards creating a more stable world.Yunus's warnings come at a time when poverty is on the rise in many parts of the world.

The proposed pact has stirred heated debates among parliamentarians, as Iraq faces growing tensions between Iran and the US.The new agreement, titled the \"US-Iraq Military Cooperation Pact,\" aims to support Iraq's military infrastructure, provide training and equipment, and assist in counter-terrorism efforts. If approved, it would replace the existing Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) signed in 2008, which was intended to guide long-term security, political, and economic relations between the two countries.The proposed pact has sparked divisions among parliamentarians, as some argue that it is necessary for Iraq to maintain strong relations with the US to counter potential threats, while others claim that the agreement would only provoke further tensions, particularly with Iran.\"The new pact represents a positive shift in our relations with the United States, aiming to protect our national security and sovereignty,\" said Ali Al-Hamdani, a member of the Iraqi Parliament from the governing coalition. \"We need the support of our American allies to modernize our armed forces, fight terrorism, and restore stability in our country.\"However, the agreement has also drawn criticism from Iraqi lawmakers, especially those with close ties to Iran, who argue that it would only serve to further undermine Iraq's sovereignty and potentially escalate regional tensions. \"Our priority should be to maintain our national unity, not to deepen our alliance with a foreign power that has already caused so much suffering in our country,\" said Falah Al-Khafaji, a member of the Iraqi Parliament from the opposition.The Iraqi government, led by Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, has been working to balance its relations with both the US and Iran, which have seen a dramatic escalation in hostilities since 2018. In January 2020, the US assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil prompted outrage and calls for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq, but the situation has since calmed, allowing for the negotiation of a new military agreement.In recent weeks, Iraqi security forces have increased their efforts to root out remaining ISIS militants from their strongholds in northern and western Iraq, in cooperation with the US-led international coalition.",

The island has long been facing water scarcity due to its location and limited water sources.

Kiriakou revealed that he was present when the detainee, Abu Zubaydah, was subjected to waterboarding, a technique that involves pouring water over a cloth covering the prisoner's face to simulate drowning.\"At the time, I felt that waterboarding was something that we needed to do,\" Kiriakou wrote. \"I thought it was necessary to save American lives. But I have since come to the conclusion that it was torture.\"Kiriakou's admission comes amid renewed debate over the use of waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" by the CIA in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

An investigation into the project was launched by the VA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) in 2018, after a series of anonymous whistleblower complaints were made to Congress.The OIG found that the project was poorly managed, with inadequate oversight and miscommunication between the VA and its contractors. The report also highlighted the use of “cost-plus” contracts, which allowed contractors to bill the VA for their costs plus a fee, leading to inflated prices.Despite the findings of the investigation, the VA has decided not to prosecute anyone involved in the project. Instead, the agency has implemented new safeguards to prevent similar cost overruns in future projects.A VA spokesperson said that the decision not to prosecute was based on the “complexity of the project and the limited ability to hold individuals accountable due to the passage of time and the deaths of some key players involved in the project”.The lack of accountability in the case has drawn criticism from some lawmakers and watchdog groups. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington State who chairs the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, said that the VA's decision not to prosecute was “unacceptable”.“The VA's decision not to hold anyone accountable for the massive cost overruns at the Aurora hospital is unacceptable,” said Murray.",

At trial, witnesses testified that he shot the older woman in the head, then shot her adult daughter four times as the latter begged for her life. A jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.Florida Supreme Court Justice Ricky Polston, writing for the Florida court, said the evidence did not show that Johnson’s mental illness and retardation caused “significant limitations” in his ability to “adapt to daily life.”Adaptation is a key element under Florida law in determining mental retardation.Johnson’s lawyers argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that he was eligible to be spared because the combined weight of his mental illness and retardation resulted in significant limitations in his ability to function. They noted that Johnson suffers from schizophrenia and major depression.The Supreme Court barred executing the mentally disabled in 2002 but left it up to the states to determine who qualified.",

There are concerns that this move will hurt businesses that rely on foreign workers to meet their labor demand.The high Australian dollar is putting pressure on many sectors, with the worst hit being manufacturing and agriculture. Some believe that with a falling demand for labor and the strength of the Australian dollar, it will hurt the nation’s ability to import foreign labor.Others are saying that the cut to skilled immigration is a pre-emptive strike ahead of a recession. Recently, economists have warned that the European sovereign debt crisis could send Australia into a recession. It would also bring the commodity boom to a halt and hurt the Australian economy.Australian immigration will also undergo other changes. It is cutting the number of people it lets into the country without skills. At the same time, it will increase the number of spouses and partners of existing Australian citizens being brought into the country.Most of the immigrants coming to Australia will come as skilled labor. The country will also target more entrepreneur immigrants who invest in local businesses and help create jobs.The move comes as Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, with only a few months before the general election, tries to show leadership in a tough economy. Immigration is a hot button issue in the country.

Researchers from the University of East Anglia and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital have developed a test that can detect aggressive forms of the disease with 90% accuracy.The test works by detecting specific molecules in urine samples that are linked to prostate cancer. It is non-invasive and could help reduce the need for unnecessary biopsies, which can be uncomfortable and carry a risk of infection.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with around 1.3 million cases diagnosed each year worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment, but current methods such as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test can be unreliable and often lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.Lead author Dr. Jeremy Clark said: \"The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer include blood tests, a physical examination known as a digital rectal examination (DRE), an MRI scan or a biopsy. We developed a urine test that looks for a specific molecule that is found in high levels in aggressive prostate cancer.\"The team is now planning to carry out larger clinical trials to validate the accuracy of the urine test and to further refine its ability to detect different stages and grades of the disease.If successful, the test could be available for use in clinics within the next few years and could help improve the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer.",

As prices have fallen from around $115 a barrel in June to less than $50 this week, importers are saving tens of billions of dollars.Officials say the slump is providing a good opportunity for Beijing to build its oil stockpile. State media argue it is helping keep inflation in check and boosting economic growth.But as oil prices remain low, some have voiced concerns about the risks that poses to China.Tan Hao, a senior lecturer at Australia’s University of Newcastle, says risks include a greater reliance on oil products that could further threaten China’s environment as well as over-reliance on oil imports and oil related financial assets.Threat to new energy technologies He says the slide also threatens to stifle the development of new energy technologies in China.“In an economic sense, yes, China benefits from the recent sharp fall in oil prices,\" Tan admitted. \"But, we should also bear in mind that there are some negative sides of the falling oil prices, especially the unwanted affects on the ongoing energy transition currently under way in China.”While widely unpopular, one way authorities could help avoid that, Tan and other analysts argue, is by raising the country’s oil consumption tax.

The initiative seeks to bridge the language barrier that has historically contributed to misunderstandings and tensions among these two major ethnic groups.The bilingual training program is set to be implemented in government institutions, including the police force, judiciary, and public administration. In addition, schools and colleges will offer the program, ensuring that the younger generation has an opportunity to learn both languages and develop an appreciation for the diverse cultures present in the island nation.Ethnic tensions between the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese and the primarily Hindu Tamils have a long and complicated history in Sri Lanka. This rift culminated in a brutal civil war that lasted from 1983 to 2009, resulting in thousands of deaths and displacements. Since the end of the conflict, the government has attempted to reconcile the two communities and promote social cohesion.The bilingual training initiative has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some view it as a positive step towards unity and understanding, while others see it as an insufficient measure to address the deep-rooted issues surrounding the ethnic divide. Critics argue that more needs to be done to address systemic inequalities and injustices faced by the Tamil minority.Despite these criticisms, the government remains committed to the program and hopes that it will serve as a catalyst for further dialogue and understanding between the two communities. Officials believe that improved communication and a shared appreciation for both languages and cultures can help Sri Lankans navigate their differences and contribute to lasting peace and stability in the region.The bilingual training program also has the potential to benefit Sri Lanka economically. By increasing language proficiency among the population, the country can strengthen trade relations with Tamil-speaking countries like India and Singapore. Additionally, the bilingual workforce will be better equipped to work in the growing tourism industry, which is a key driver of the national economy.As Sri Lanka embarks on this new initiative, it is hoped that the bilingual training program will encourage greater understanding between the country's diverse communities and promote lasting unity and prosperity for all Sri Lankans.",

According to the president, those who lost their votes in last year's elections will be given new opportunity to join the political process, but the main opposition groups and other opposition figures will not be given any chance.Maduro's announcement comes after an agreement in which the Venezuelan government and the political opposition have agreed to hold elections in October.The United States and its allies have been critical of Maduro's government, which they claim is not committed to the democratic process.",

        "text": "A train derailment in northwest Iowa has led to an estimated spillage of 230,000 gallons of crude oil, according to BNSF Railway, the company responsible for the train. The accident occurred on Friday, June 22, when 32 of the train's oil tanker cars derailed near the town of Doon, causing a massive oil spill that threatened the nearby Rock River.BNSF spokesman Andy Williams said 14 of the derailed cars had dumped an estimated 230,000 gallons of crude oil into the floodwaters, while some of the oil has been contained using booms near the site. The exact cause of the derailment is still under investigation, but it is believed that heavy rains and flooding in the area may have contributed to the incident.The incident has raised concerns about the environmental impact of the spill on the surrounding ecosystem and water resources. The Rock River, which is currently at flood stage, could carry the spilled oil downstream and potentially contaminate drinking water sources for nearby communities.Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds visited the site on Saturday and was in contact with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and BNSF officials to discuss potential clean-up and containment measures. BNSF Railway and the EPA have deployed additional containment booms and skimming equipment to help minimize the spread of oil and to speed up the clean-up process.The Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring air quality and providing resources for water sampling and analysis to ensure the health and safety of nearby residents. Residents of the nearby towns, including Rock Valley, were urged to conserve water, as the city’s water treatment plant was shut down as a precautionary measure.This derailment comes just a few months after a similar incident involving a BNSF train near Custer, Washington, where an estimated 29,000 gallons of crude oil spilled after a collision with a semi-truck.BNSF Railway has said that it will work closely with local, state, and federal authorities to ensure a quick and thorough clean-up of the area, and to determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, affected residents and environmental groups will be keeping a close watch on the containment and clean-up efforts, and the long-term effects of the spill on the region's ecosystems and resources.",

        "text": "A recent report by a panel of experts warns that the tightening of sanctions on Iran could lead to negative consequences for ordinary Iranian citizens, as the nation continues to grapple with both economic instability and a heightened regional conflict.The stringent measures, initially put in place by the United States and other countries in response to Iran's ongoing nuclear program and aggressive foreign policies, have directly impacted the nation's economy, forcing businesses to close and causing a surge in unemployment rates. According to several analysts, the tightening of these sanctions could result in prolonged economic stagnation, further diminishing the quality of life for many Iranians.The increase in sanctions has also crippled Iran's healthcare system, as import restrictions on vital medical equipment and pharmaceuticals have led to a shortage in essential supplies. Consequently, many Iranians are struggling to access basic healthcare services and life-saving medications, raising significant concerns about the nation's public health.Critics of the sanctions argue that they do little to penalize Iran's political leadership, who are protected by their positions and wealth, and instead disproportionately harm the general population. Some also contend that the recent assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and the ongoing proxy conflicts with the US in the Middle East have only served to unite the Iranian people behind their government, undermining efforts to promote democratic change.The report suggests that the economic pressure resulting from these sanctions is ultimately counterproductive, as it emboldens Iran to retaliate against perceived foreign aggression by stepping up their nuclear and military ambitions. It also warns that the mounting discontent among the Iranian population could lead to social unrest, potentially destabilizing the region further.Experts are urging the international community to revisit their strategy on Iran, suggesting that efforts should focus on diplomatic engagement and targeted sanctions against key individuals and organizations involved in illicit activities, rather than imposing blanket economic measures that affect the entire population. By promoting dialogue and cooperation, they argue that a more sustainable and effective solution can be achieved to address the underlying issues of regional security and nuclear proliferation.In the meantime, humanitarian organizations are calling on governments to exempt vital medical supplies from the sanctions regime, to ensure that vulnerable Iranians can continue to access essential healthcare services. This would not only alleviate some of the immediate suffering but also potentially foster goodwill among the Iranian population and prevent the further erosion of trust between Iran and the international community.",

While Hart had addressed the issue in previous years and issued an apology, he has continued to face criticism for his past behavior.In a series of new social media exchanges, Hart has responded to some critics by attempting to justify his previous actions and dismiss the significance of the tweets, stating that people change and grow. However, these responses have been met with further disapproval as many have accused him of not taking full responsibility for his past actions and failing to adequately address the harm he caused.One Twitter user asked Hart, \"How can you apologize for something, then justify it? That's not really an apology.\" This sentiment has been echoed by many who believe that the comedian's attempts to both apologize and justify his behavior are contradictory and indicate a lack of understanding of the impact of his words.As the controversy continues to unfold, several celebrities and prominent members of the LGBTQ+ community have weighed in on the situation. Many have expressed disappointment and frustration with Hart's handling of the issue, stating that a genuine apology and willingness to learn from past mistakes would have been a more appropriate response.In the past, Hart has been vocal about his support for the LGBTQ+ community, which has led to confusion and disappointment among his fans as they grapple with his contradictory statements and actions.Despite the ongoing backlash, Hart's career has not taken a significant hit. The actor and comedian recently starred in the film \"Fatherhood\" and has several upcoming projects in the pipeline.However, the continued controversy surrounding his past tweets serves as a reminder of the power of social media and the long-lasting effects that offensive and harmful language can have on an individual's public image and reputation. As public figures like Hart continue to grapple with their past actions, the importance of accountability and sincere apologies remains a crucial factor in the court of public opinion.",

The ruling has been seen as a major setback for the families of the victims of the attack, who had sought to hold Sudan accountable for its role in the bombing.The USS Cole was attacked by terrorists while refueling in the port of Aden in Yemen, resulting in the deaths of 17 American sailors. Sudan had been accused of providing support to the terrorists who carried out the attack, but the Supreme Court has now ruled that Sudan is immune from lawsuits in US courts.The decision has been met with criticism from some quarters, with many arguing that Sudan should not be granted immunity for its alleged role in the attack. However, others have welcomed the ruling, saying that it is important to respect the sovereignty of other nations.The legal battle over the USS Cole bombing is ongoing, and it remains to be seen how this ruling will impact the case as a whole. However, one thing is clear - the US Supreme Court's decision to throw out the judgement against Sudan is a significant development that will likely have implications for other cases involving foreign nations and terrorism.",

The prosecution case has been framed on a charge that Anwar sexually harassed a female staffer at an office he led.On Friday (December 8), Mahathir said Anwar's detention was an attempt to \"pervert\" the legal system which is only a \"bastion\" of democracy.Mahathir said the trial is the final test before Anwar's pre-trial detention, scheduled for December 15.Mahathir has accused Anwar of wanting to challenge his previous government's handling of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1Malaysia) scandal. He has also accused Anwar of wanting to return to power in the country through the use of the new law to prosecute him.Anwar's lawyer, Dato' Seri Saiful Maliki, said Mahathir's remarks show that Anwar will still be sentenced for his alleged misconduct. Anwar will also be given a three-year prison term if he is found guilty, which he is expected to do.Anwar has been in custody since the end of last year, when he was first arrested at a clinic run by his aide, S. Selvaganapathy.S. Selvaganapathy was also charged with abusing a position to pervert public morals and defiling the name of the Prime Minister in a case filed in December 2016. S. Selvaganapathy was freed on bail after an 11-month court trial, which was held in three sessions, before Anwar's case was reopened last Friday.Mahathir was sworn in as the Prime Minister on December 13, after winning a parliamentary majority, over Barisan Nasional (BN), a coalition of parties that had ruled the country since 1957.",

The survey, conducted by the Victorian Ambulance Association, found that a significant percentage of emergency workers were experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).According to the survey, emergency workers who responded to traumatic incidents were more likely to experience psychological distress than those who did not. This includes incidents such as accidents, natural disasters, and violent crimes. The survey also found that emergency workers who worked long hours and had poor work-life balance were more likely to experience psychological distress.The findings of the survey highlight the need for more support for emergency workers in Australia. This includes both preventative measures, such as improved training and mental health screening, as well as support for those who are already experiencing psychological distress. The Victorian Ambulance Association has called for more funding to be directed towards mental health services for emergency workers.The issue of psychological stress among emergency workers is not unique to Australia. In many countries, emergency workers are exposed to traumatic incidents on a regular basis and are at high risk of developing mental health problems. It is essential that more attention is paid to this issue and that adequate support is provided to those who are on the front lines of emergency response.",

They point to the harshness of the sentence and argue that it is a violation of international human rights law.In response, the Iranian government has stated that Siddiqui was only charged with a criminal offense due to his “provocative” behavior.

Once a vital source of water for millions of people in the region, the lake has been rapidly shrinking due to climate change, overuse, and pollution.The governments of the four countries surrounding the lake – Chad, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon – have been working to address the problem, but the scale of the challenge is immense. To save Lake Chad, a comprehensive and coordinated effort will be needed, involving not just the governments, but also the local populations and international organizations.The situation is particularly urgent in Nigeria, where the waters of Lake Chad have been diverted for irrigation and other purposes, leaving the lake with only a fraction of its original volume. In addition to reducing the amount of water flowing into the lake, there is also a need to address pollution from agricultural runoff and other sources.One potential solution is the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Chari River, which flows into Lake Chad. The dam would help regulate the flow of water into the lake and provide a source of clean energy for the region. However, the dam would also require the cooperation of all four countries, as well as the involvement of international donors.Another important aspect of the effort to save Lake Chad is raising awareness among the local populations about the importance of the lake and the need for conservation. This will require education campaigns and other outreach efforts to help people understand the consequences of their actions on the lake and its ecosystem.The fate of Lake Chad is not just a regional concern, but a global one. The lake is home to a rich diversity of plant and animal life, and its waters are critical for the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.  will require a collaborative effort from all those involved, but the rewards will be significant, both for the environment and for the people of the region.",

The only group that comes close is U2 and its backing band, which makes a decent percentage of the audience, but that is far from a majority.And while the tour will allow the band to catch a breather from the rigors of tour, the fans will still have to wait longer than usual to hear their favorite songs.

A car bomb planted by the Real IRA, a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army, exploded in the town's bustling market area, killing 29 people, including nine children, and injuring over 200 others. The incident remains the deadliest single attack in the history of the Northern Ireland conflict.The accused, whose name has not been released due to legal restrictions, has been formally charged with 29 counts of murder, two charges of terrorism-related offenses, and one count of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life. The suspect appeared in court on Friday, where he spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. He has been remanded in custody and will appear in court again on October 1.The breakthrough in this case comes after years of relentless pursuit of justice by the victims' families, who have campaigned for charges to be brought against those responsible for the attack.",

This follows the historic summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore last month. The US delegation to North Korea is being led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is focused on establishing a timeline and roadmap for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. In a statement released today, he said “We are committed to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and have made progress in that direction.\"The US and North Korea are currently engaged in negotiations to develop a joint document that would outline the steps toward denuclearization. However, neither side has yet to produce any specific details. Secretary Pompeo noted that there is still much work to be done before any agreement could be reached, including setting clear expectations and determining what the end state for North Korea’s nuclear program would look like.The Trump administration's goal is for North Korea to take immediate and verifiable steps to give up its nuclear weapons. In exchange, the US is offering economic and diplomatic incentives, including the possible lifting of sanctions. North Korean officials have been evasive about whether they are willing to meet the US’s demands. However, they have expressed a desire for an end to the economic sanctions that have crippled the country in recent years.The US and North Korea continue to negotiate the terms of a possible long-term agreement. The success of these talks will have a major impact on the future of the Korean Peninsula and the world.",

This unprecedented step has the potential to significantly alter the religious landscape and deepen the unity between these two major branches of Christianity.The new structure, called \"personal ordinariates,\" will be a unique arrangement within the Catholic Church that allows Anglicans to maintain their liturgical traditions and Anglican identity, while being in full communion with the Pope. According to the Vatican, this move is in response to numerous requests from Anglicans who have expressed the desire to join the Catholic Church, but did not want to completely abandon their Anglican roots.Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, stated that the Catholic Church is responding with a sense of \"generous openness\" to these requests, and is hopeful that this new arrangement will help promote unity within the Christian community. The Vatican's official statement emphasizes that this move does not imply the negation of the Anglican tradition, but rather a recognition of its richness and the desire to welcome it within the Catholic Church.This significant development comes amid increasing tensions within the Anglican Communion, particularly due to disagreements over issues such as the ordination of women and LGBTQ clergy, and the blessing of same-sex unions. Some conservative Anglicans have been looking to the Catholic Church as a more traditional and unified alternative, and this new provision could make it more appealing for them to make the switch.However, not everyone is thrilled with this announcement. The Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the Anglican Communion, expressed his concern that the Catholic Church's move might be perceived as an act of \"poaching\" Anglicans, rather than a genuine effort to promote unity. Furthermore, some Anglicans may feel that this decision undermines their ongoing dialogue with the Catholic Church, aimed at finding common ground and potentially moving toward reunification.Nevertheless, the Roman Catholic Church remains optimistic that this new provision will be a significant step in the right direction.",

While some have praised her efforts to increase trade relations with African nations, others have criticized her lack of action on issues such as human rights abuses and climate change.May's Africa policy was largely focused on promoting British trade interests on the continent. She made multiple visits to African nations, including South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya, in an effort to secure trade deals. Her government also hosted the UK-Africa Investment Summit in January of this year, which saw the announcement of over £6.5 billion in new commercial deals.However, May's critics have argued that her focus on trade has come at the expense of addressing crucial human rights issues. Many have accused her of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in countries such as Cameroon and Zimbabwe, where protesters have been met with violence and repression. May's government has also been criticized for its lack of action on climate change, with some suggesting that it has failed to prioritize environmental concerns in its dealings with African nations.Overall, May's Africa policy has been a source of both praise and criticism. While her efforts to increase trade relations have been welcomed by some, others have called for a more holistic approach that takes into account issues such as human rights and climate change. As May prepares to leave office, it remains to be seen how her successor will approach Africa policy and whether they will address some of the concerns raised during her tenure.",

Meanwhile, Africa accounted for 4% of the global economic losses, though it is expected to suffer the most in the coming years due to the continent’s already high levels of poverty and limited access to resources.The report warns that while Asia is the most exposed to the effects of natural disasters, the actual number of lives lost and economic damage inflicted could be much greater due to its large population. As a result, it is essential that countries in the region focus on strengthening their ability to respond to and recover from disasters, as well as implementing greater climate resilience efforts.Meanwhile, the report also recommends that countries in Africa prioritize economic development that is more resilient to climate risks. For instance, investment in renewable energy sources and adaptation of traditional agricultural practices to climate change could help reduce disaster risk, as well as support poverty reduction and economic growth.Overall, the findings of this report underscore the need for greater investments in disaster risk reduction and climate resilience measures in order to minimize the number of lives lost and the amount of economic damage inflicted by natural disasters.",

Investing in farming gives you the capacity to increase food production and thereby increase farmers' incomes. You may have increased productivity but in many cases, your food production will not be sufficient to meet people's food requirements\" he said.Dr. Soglo said that in this era of high food prices, investment in agriculture remains the most efficient form of increasing food production, and is therefore the most important factor of sustainable development.\"It would be a tragedy if a country does not take the lead in increasing agricultural investment but is unable to meet its own food needs. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has invested more than US$3 billion in African countries, and if you compare what we have achieved, the US$3 billion figure is very small\" he said.Dr. Soglo said that Africa is experiencing an agriculture revolution as the continent becomes more industrialized.\"The increase in the number of Africans and the development of new technologies is leading to higher yields per hectare, and the number of cattle being raised per hectare is rising\" he said, pointing out that the number of cattle per hectare in Africa is now 10 times that of the world.Dr. Soglo also noted that with the huge population growth in Africa, this has also resulted in increased cattle per hectare and greater population densities on many of the continent's rural areas.\"This means more people are on farms and using the same number of resources to support the same number of households.",

The experts, comprising judges, attorneys, and human rights advocates, have requested the International Criminal Court (ICC) to conduct an impartial investigation into Israel's actions, particularly regarding potential violations of international humanitarian law.The call for inquiry comes after several incidents, including airstrikes on residential buildings in Gaza and reported attacks on media organizations, which resulted in significant civilian casualties. Israel has argued that such actions were taken in response to rocket fire from Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, but the justice experts have raised concerns about the proportionality and legality of these measures under international law.The international justice experts highlighted Israel's alleged targeting of civilian infrastructure, which constitutes a breach of the laws of armed conflict. They also referred to reports of forced evictions of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem and ongoing settlement expansion in the West Bank as possible evidence of war crimes under the Rome Statute, which established the ICC.\"The international community cannot turn a blind eye to the possible commission of war crimes and other serious violations of international law in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\" the experts said in a joint statement. \"All parties, including Israel, should be held accountable for any unlawful conduct.\"The group of experts also called upon the United Nations to establish an independent commission of inquiry to document and preserve evidence of potential war crimes and ensure that those responsible are held accountable. They urged the ICC prosecutor to take the necessary steps to ensure that the investigation is comprehensive, impartial, and transparent.Israel has not ratified the Rome Statute and therefore does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. Nevertheless, the Palestinian Authority, which became a member of the ICC in 2015, has granted the Court jurisdiction over the territories it claims, including Gaza and the West Bank.In response to the call for inquiry, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the allegations and accused the international justice experts of being \"biased and unfounded.\" The ministry further argued that Israel \"has a robust legal system capable of investigating and prosecuting any alleged violations of international law.\"As the situation in the region remains tense, international pressure continues to mount on Israel to cease hostilities and engage in meaningful dialogue with Palestinian representatives.",

The Boring Company has described the tunnel as a “proof of concept” that will demonstrate the company’s ability to create tunnels for public use.The unveiling of the tunnel will take place on Tuesday and Musk is expected to make an appearance and share more details about the project. Members of the press and local dignitaries will be invited to tour the tunnel and watch as Musk demonstrates the speed of the tunnel, reaching speeds of up to 130 miles per hour. The ambitious project has met with mixed reviews, with some praising the potential of advanced tunnel technology and others concerned about traffic congestion and disruption to the surrounding area.Whatever the outcome, the unveiling of the tunnel is an exciting development and a step forward in Musk's mission to revolutionize the way we travel.",

The contested election sparked months of protests and violence that left hundreds dead and drove hundreds of thousands of Burundians out of the country.Nkurunziza left office last year and his hand-picked successor was elected in a contested election in May.In his statement, Pompeo urged the Burundian government to take meaningful action to end the violence, protect civil society activists, and hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations. He also called on Burundi to create a more conducive environment for a democratic transition.",

The North has dismissed the accusations and warned South Sudan not to make inflammatory statements.South Sudanese officials claim to have evidence that the North is supporting the attacks with military equipment and personnel, while the North's foreign minister has denied all such allegations. He has also accused the South of encouraging violence and promoting ethnic division in the disputed border area.The accusations have sparked further controversy surrounding the issue, and the two countries have failed to reach a diplomatic solution to the situation, leaving the border area in a dangerous limbo.### Instruction:Create a list of books that are about artificial intelligence.Task: Create the list of books.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (CN) – Accused of seven counts, the first one related to obstruction, in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, a federal judge in Washington on Tuesday heard arguments regarding how much of the case federal prosecutors are required to disclose.After Mueller handed the investigation over to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia in May, Stone's case was transferred to a grand jury, where he was charged with lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing a federal proceeding – all felony charges.He is also accused of making false statements to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about his communications with the Trump campaign regarding the possible existence of certain emails hacked by Russian operatives and disseminated by WikiLeaks.For nearly 30 minutes Tuesday morning, Stone's defense argued before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson that the government's redacted and unredacted versions of the grand jury subpoena that was served to Stone should be unsealed because he has a right to view the unredacted version.But Jackson, a Barack Obama appointee, said she was not inclined to allow Stone to view the grand jury subpoena because it contained information about witnesses who might appear before the grand jury.\"That's not a matter that will affect Mr. Stone's ability to defend himself,\" Jackson said.Stone is scheduled to go on trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Nov. 5.Jackson said she wants to be thorough in her review of the case but wants it over quickly.\"This case needs to get to trial quickly. It has already been a lengthy process,\" Jackson said.In one instance, prosecutors alleged that Stone lied to the House committee about how he did not have emails from any intermediary to WikiLeaks but then emails revealed Stone had discussed a possible intermediary with the campaign.Stone has said through his lawyers that the unredacted version of the subpoena would show that a conservative author named Jerome Corsi, whom the government is trying to subpoena, was the intermediary.The government says that in reality, Corsi is cooperating with Mueller's team but that the unredacted version of the subpoena is under seal because Mueller is still looking into the matter.\"",

        "text": "In a surprising development, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reached out to China, urging for new nuclear talks with the US and South Korea. This move by Kim Jong-un comes after the failure of the Hanoi summit earlier this year, where negotiations between North Korea and the United States stalled.The North Korean leader sent a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, proposing that China take a more proactive role in mediating discussions, given the current strained relationship between the United States and North Korea. The Chinese government has confirmed receiving the letter from Kim Jong-un and expressed its willingness to support new talks.Kim Jong-un's letter highlighted the need for fresh talks to maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and emphasized the importance of China's role as a responsible global power. The letter also mentioned Kim's interest in enhancing economic cooperation with China.China has been North Korea's longtime ally and a key provider of economic assistance. In recent years, however, China has been more vocal in its criticism of North Korea's nuclear program and its ballistic missile tests, in line with the United Nations' resolutions.Experts believe that Kim Jong-un's outreach to China might be a strategic move to gain leverage in future negotiations with the United States. The North Korean leader has been seeking relief from crippling economic sanctions imposed by the international community.In response to the letter, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that China has always supported the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and stands ready to play a constructive role in promoting dialogues between North Korea, the United States, and South Korea.US President Joe Biden has previously indicated that his administration is willing to engage with North Korea, but only under the condition of a comprehensive, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization.",
