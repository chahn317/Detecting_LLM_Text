Raymond Benjamin's comments come as European airports begin gradually resuming flights after a five-day shut down due to a huge cloud of volcanic ash making its way from Iceland across Europe. Benjamin said his organization, which is a specialized U.N. agency dealing with air safety, held a special meeting Monday on the issue of volcanic ash standards. \"We are going to convene a group of people - industry, manufacturers, IATA [International Air Transport Association], governments, scientists - to start working on these standards,\" he said.He said no international standards currently exist stating what concentration of volcanic ash could affect a jet's engine. Tiny particles in the ash can cause engines to stall or shut down and do other damage to planes.Benjamin said the standards would be \"guidance material\" for countries. The International Civil Aviation Authority gathers scientific information on volcanic ash at nine centers worldwide, which it then provides to governments. But Benjamin said the decision and responsibility for closing airspace lies solely with individual countries.Asked if he would fly, Benjamin said he would. \"So when you are asking, would you fly?",

Meanwhile, senior leaders of Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party are preparing to discuss President Robert Mugabe's proposal to postpone presidential elections scheduled for next year. Southern Africa Correspondent Scott Bobb reports from our bureau in Johannesburg.Leaders of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) called the meeting after police detained and severely beat several dozen opposition leaders who were trying to hold an anti-government rally two weeks ago.The incident was widely condemned by the international community. Reaction was milder from African leaders who expressed concern, but indicated they preferred to use diplomacy to bring change to Zimbabwe.The head of the Capetown-based Transitional Justice-in-Africa Program, Brian Raftopoulos, says this is because Mr. Mugabe still enjoys some support among African leaders.\"He is not someone who is completely isolated,\" he noted. \"And he does understand that even if SADC are looking to find a way through they have to do so in a way that is seen as an African initiative.\"Raftopoulos says the Zimbabwean president, who reportedly will attend the summit, is likely to seek sympathy by portraying the opposition as an agent of outside forces and himself as a victim of foreign interference.But he says there is also a realization among some African leaders that this argument is no longer sufficient.",

The leaders of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela were not invited to the event.The absence of these leaders was attributed to political tensions between their respective countries and the new Salvadoran president. Bukele has been vocal about his disapproval of the governments of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, accusing them of corruption and human rights abuses.Although the presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama attended Bukele's inauguration, the absence of his counterparts from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela highlighted the political divisions within the region.Bukele, who won the presidential election in February, is the first president in three decades who is not affiliated with either of the two traditional political parties in El Salvador. He has promised to tackle corruption, reduce crime, and improve the economy of the country.During his inaugural speech, Bukele called for unity among Salvadorans and emphasized the need for regional cooperation to address issues such as migration and drug trafficking.

The statement comes amid increasing tensions between Ukraine and Russia, with recent reports of Russian military build-up near the Ukrainian border sparking fears of a potential conflict.Obama emphasized the need for the international community to rally behind Ukraine, as he said, \"We must be united in our support for Ukraine's right to determine its own destiny, free from any outside interference.\" He also called on Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and refrain from escalating tensions.The former president's statement highlights concerns over potential Russian aggression, as Moscow has been accused of illegally annexing Crimea in 2014 and supporting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Since then, the region has been plagued by violence, with more than 14,000 lives lost in the ongoing conflict.In response to the recent Russian military movements, several western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, have called on Russia to de-escalate and pull back its troops.

This unexpected boost in crop production comes as a welcome respite for the agricultural community, which has faced challenges ranging from trade disputes to changing climate patterns in recent years.The Midwest region, often referred to as the Corn Belt, consists of several states including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska. This area is responsible for the majority of corn production in the United States and has a significant impact on global food supply chains. An early harvest allows farmers to take advantage of better market prices, while also providing consumers with fresh produce sooner than anticipated.Experts believe that a mild winter and early spring contributed to the accelerated growth of corn crops, as these conditions allowed farmers to plant their fields several weeks ahead of schedule. Additionally, advances in agricultural technology and crop management practices have allowed for increased efficiency in farming operations.The early corn harvest is expected to have a positive impact on the U.S. economy, as it will likely lead to a surplus of corn, resulting in lower prices for feed grains and other agricultural products. This could be a significant boon for livestock and poultry producers, who rely heavily on corn for feed. Additionally, industries that use corn in manufacturing, such as ethanol production and food processing, will benefit from the increased availability of this staple crop.However, there are some concerns that the early harvest may be accompanied by an increased risk of crop damage due to pests and disease, as warmer temperatures and shorter growing seasons can create a more favorable environment for harmful organisms. Farmers are advised to remain vigilant in monitoring their crops for signs of infestation and to take preventative measures to protect their yields.Despite these concerns, the early corn harvest has been widely celebrated in the agricultural community. Farmers, who have been hit hard by recent trade wars and extreme weather events, view the early harvest as a glimmer of hope in an otherwise challenging landscape.",

The Bush administration and a growing number of foreign policy experts say failed states pose a threat to world peace and security. But there are critics who argue that intervening in a failed state can do more harm than good.Gul Khan was just a boy when his family left its village near Jalalabad to escape the war in Afghanistan. For more than 30 years, he lived in Pakistan because he says it was too dangerous to return. Today he is coming home. \"I am asking my brothers and villagers to come back to this village and this lovely country. If they come back, we can rebuild,\" he says.While Gul Khan may feel safe to return home, foreign policy analysts at the private Brookings Institution in the United States recently listed Afghanistan as a failed state. Brookings' weak-state index says that six years after the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan remains plagued by slow reconstruction, a weak central government, and war.Democratic Congressman Adam Smith is a long-time advocate for international intervention in failing states on humanitarian grounds. He says Afghanistan exemplifies why collapsed states present a threat to the world.\"Afghanistan was a failed state where al-Qaida was able to find a safe haven and launch the 9/11 [i.e., September 11, 2001] attacks against this country. If Afghanistan had not been a failed state, that would not have been a safe place for people like Osama bin Laden to go,\" says Smith.Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the Bush administration, and many in the foreign policy establishment, have advocated intervention in failed states to save them.",

And what will this new media entity be like? And who will it represent? And what impact will that have on the Zimbabwean democratic process? The Sunday Mail’s story of political interference in Zimbabwe is yet another example that the government has done little to protect the country’s independent media.Independent media have long been a target in Zimbabwe. In the 1990s, a government of former President Robert Mugabe threatened to close all private media in the country. But it wasn’t just the media that was subject to pressure. Mugabe’s regime also targeted the opposition, which was outlawed and subjected to harassment.Since taking office in 2017, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has also tried to curtail the independence of the independent media. He attempted to dissolve the Zimbabwean Communications Regulatory Authority (Zimra), a statutory body established in 2000 to regulate the private sector’s use of radio and television in Zimbabwe.Mnangagwa’s assault on free speech is particularly alarming in light of the country’s constitutional provisions on the freedom to receive and distribute information. Article 40(2)(b) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe provides: “Every Zimbabwean shall have the right to freedom of expression, the right to receive and to communicate information, and to have and to dispose of his private correspondence and messages.”The government’s continued assault on the freedom to receive and communicate information is a serious concern. The government’s continued refusal to grant accreditation to independent media representatives is a clear infringement of those constitutional rights.The government has also suspended Zimbabwe’s two major news websites, including the state-owned state-owned newspaper, the Zimbabwean Times, the oldest newspaper in Africa. According to a recent report, the Zimbabwean government is planning to shut down private media outlets to discourage the spread of negative news stories about government officials.The Zimra’s closure came in response to complaints from independent media houses that the publication had failed to comply with a letter of instruction dated 17 October 2018, which ordered the publication to cease all unauthorised publishing and distribution of news.",

Recent studies show that a written prescription for exercise helps motivate people to get moving. People around the world spend billions of dollars each year on medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure and control weight and diabetes.Doctors -- and most of their patients -- know that exercise is one of the best things people can do for themselves. Exercise lowers cholesterol, helps control diabetes, contributes to weight loss, and lowers blood pressure. Just as importantly, it reduces the need for medications to control many of these conditions. Professor Miriam Morey led the most recent study on prescribing exercise. She focused on cancer survivors like Joe Collie, who had surgery for prostate cancer. \"The operation was in July of '93, so it's been 16 years since I had that procedure,\" he explains.Collie and more than 600 other cancer survivors went on diets and exercise programs tailored to their needs.

Others have argued that the announcement is a sign of the military's continued influence in Egyptian politics, and could signal a return to the authoritarian rule that characterized the country's political landscape for decades.The move has also raised concerns about the state of democracy in Egypt, with many questioning whether the country is truly on a path towards democratic reform.",

        "text": "Recent months have seen an unprecedented surge in migrants arriving at the US Southern border, with officials warning that the situation is \"overwhelming the system.\" Many of those attempting to cross the border are families and unaccompanied minors hailing primarily from Central American countries plagued by violence, corruption, and economic hardships. The sharp increase in arrivals has placed a strain on resources, as border agents struggle to process and accommodate the migrants and address their humanitarian needs.In March, over 170,000 migrants were apprehended at the border, marking the highest single-month total in more than 15 years. According to the US Border Patrol, this represents a 70% increase in apprehensions compared to February. Notably, almost 19,000 of the migrants were unaccompanied minors, a record-breaking figure that has underscored the urgent need for action.The Biden administration has faced mounting criticism from both sides of the aisle for its handling of the situation. While the administration has announced plans to invest $4 billion in Central America to address the root causes of migration, it is evident that immediate measures are needed to cope with the ongoing crisis.Despite attempts to deter migrants from making the perilous journey, the sheer volume of arrivals has overwhelmed detention facilities, with some holding more than four times their intended capacity. This has led to unsanitary and overcrowded conditions that have raised concerns among human rights groups.In response to the crisis, the administration has deployed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to the border to assist in managing the influx of migrants and to create temporary shelters. The Department of Health and Human Services has also taken steps to house unaccompanied minors in facilities beyond the border, such as military bases and convention centers.However, these efforts have not been without controversy. Transparency has been a significant concern, as the administration has placed restrictions on media access to the facilities. This has fueled speculation about the true nature of conditions within the centers and prompted calls for greater openness from the press and advocacy groups.In addition to the humanitarian issues, the administration must also contend with the political ramifications of the situation. Republicans have been quick to blame the Biden administration for the surge in migrants, asserting that its more lenient immigration policies have incentivized dangerous journeys to the border.",

Childbirth care is supposed to be free in Uganda.According David Kabanda, the lawyer representing the families of the two women, the government is responsible for their deaths.“Who is supposed to build hospitals? It’s the government. Who is supposed to facilitate hospitals with enough skilled manpower? Enough health commodities and other goods? It’s the government,” said Kabanda.The Constitutional Court refused to hear the families' initial petition, filed in 2011. Judges said they didn't have authority to rule on matters such as hospital budget allocation, which is under the executive branch.But Uganda's Supreme Court dismissed that decision in November and ordered the lower court to hear the case.Peter Walumbiri, a constitutional expert, said the ruling of the Supreme Court is a significant one.“This decision opens the door for litigation in this area. It opens the door for the courts to now scrutinize government policies, government actions, government omissions.

This visit comes amid escalating political tensions in Zimbabwe, where the ruling ZANU-PF party is struggling to contain infighting and economic challenges.The Trump administration is now grappling with the dilemma of whether to openly endorse Tsvangirai's candidacy, as such a move would likely increase tensions with the already strained US-Zimbabwe relations. Furthermore, the decision has implications on the regional level, as it may influence the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU) in their political calculations.US officials are cautious not to take a stance that could be perceived as meddling in Zimbabwe's domestic politics or undermining the legitimacy of the electoral process. A senior US State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, \"We will continue to engage with all stakeholders, but we're also mindful of the need to respect Zimbabwe's sovereignty and its people's right to determine their own destiny.\"However, some observers argue that the Trump administration should not miss this opportunity to support a pro-democratic change in Zimbabwe. They point to Tsvangirai's previous tenure as Prime Minister, during which he implemented crucial political and economic reforms, as evidence of his commitment to democracy and the rule of law. Moreover, they argue that the US should take advantage of the current rifts within the ruling ZANU-PF party, which could weaken Mugabe's grip on power.Tsvangirai's visit to the US has also drawn criticism from President Mugabe's government, which has accused the opposition leader of attempting to \"invite sanctions and foreign interference\" in Zimbabwe's internal affairs. The government's spokesperson, George Charamba, said in a statement, \"Tsvangirai's meetings with American officials are nothing more than an attempt to sabotage our nation and its people.

So they reviewed outcomes of more than 1,200 patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke — a stoke in a major artery that cuts off the blood supply to the brain.Some patients received standard clot-breaking medicine and others received that plus a thrombectomy, a procedure using a tool that pulls clots out of an artery.Their findings: the sooner the patient had a thrombectomy, the better the overall recovery.\"Time makes a big difference. Every four minutes that goes by after a patient gets to the hospital, one fewer out of 100 patients has a good outcome if the artery hasn’t been opened,” says Dr. Jeffrey Saver, director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University of California Los Angeles, also known as UCLA.Blood clots in major arteries cause blood to stop flowing to the brain, and without a blood supply, the brain cells begin to die, which is why time is of the essence when treating a stroke.“If you get the artery open at three hours, then 65 percent of patients will be able to live independently three months later. If it takes eight hours to get it open, then only 45 percent will be able to live independently.",

It will be President Bashir's first visit to Juba since South Sudan gained independence last July.

The unrelenting heatwave has been affecting several states including Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico, with temperatures soaring as high as 115°F, posing risks to residents' health and overall wellbeing.The NWS has issued excessive heat warnings for several locations across the Southwest, urging residents to stay indoors, avoid unnecessary exposure to the sun, and hydrate regularly to prevent dehydration and heat-related illnesses. Officials are particularly concerned about the elderly, young children, and people with underlying medical conditions, as they are most vulnerable to the effects of the extreme heat.The NWS also states that this year's heatwave has not only affected daytime temperatures, but nighttime lows have been significantly warmer than average, making it more difficult for people to find relief from the oppressive heat. The prolonged exposure to high temperatures has put a strain on power grids, causing an increase in energy consumption as residents struggle to stay cool with fans and air conditioning.The sweltering heat has also exacerbated the ongoing drought across the Southwest, with water levels in the region's major reservoirs, such as Lake Mead and Lake Powell, reaching historically low levels. The diminishing water supply has raised concerns over agricultural and hydroelectric power production, as well as potential water restrictions for millions of residents.Authorities have been monitoring local wildfires closely, as the dry and hot conditions create a heightened risk for fire ignition and rapid spread. Firefighters have already been tackling several wildfires in the region, and experts warn that the persistent heat and drought may contribute to an extended fire season this year.Meteorologists have pointed towards climate change as a major factor influencing these extreme weather patterns, with increasing global temperatures contributing to longer and more intense heatwaves, as well as increased instances of drought and wildfires. Climate experts are urging policymakers to take decisive action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to prevent further worsening of the situation in the Southwest and across the globe.As the US Southwest grapples with the unyielding high temperatures, residents are advised to follow local guidelines and remain vigilant to minimize the risks associated with this extreme weather event.",

Spanning over six weeks and seven phases, nearly 900 million eligible voters will have the opportunity to decide the future of the world's second most populous nation. The election results will be announced on May 23rd.Under Modi's leadership, his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), achieved a landslide victory in the 2014 elections, marking the first time in 30 years that a single party had won a majority in the Indian Parliament. The 2019 elections, however, are shaping up to be a greater challenge for Modi and the BJP, as they face a resurgent opposition, led by the Indian National Congress (INC) and its president Rahul Gandhi.During his tenure as Prime Minister, Modi has implemented a series of ambitious reforms and initiatives, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), demonetization, and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign). While some of these measures have generated controversy and criticism, Modi remains a popular figure both nationally and internationally, admired for his strong leadership and ability to implement change.The key issues at the forefront of this election include national security, unemployment, agrarian distress, and economic growth. The recent escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pulwama terror attack has brought national security to the top of the agenda, giving the BJP an edge due to its tough stance on terrorism and national defense.In the face of an increasingly united opposition, the BJP has formed a pre-poll alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), with various regional parties. On the other hand, the INC has joined hands with regional heavyweights to form the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to challenge the BJP.As the elections proceed, an important factor that may sway voter sentiment is the performance of regional parties, such as the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and All India Trinamool Congress (AITC). These parties have significant influence in their respective regions and their alliances with either the NDA or the UPA could prove decisive in the election outcome.The sheer scale of the Indian General Elections is a testament to the vibrancy of the nation's democracy.",

But for many small island nations in the Pacific, China and Africa, it’s the next best thing.From a social point of view, the global telecommunications market is still fairly undeveloped. In 2014, the world’s internet traffic was estimated to be roughly 40,000 to 50,000 gigabits per second. In sub-Saharan Africa, the figure is as low as 5 to 10 gigabits per second.But the global internet is in many ways a perfect fit for these island nations, which have a high dependency on imported goods, particularly telecommunications.This trend is only going to become more pronounced as ICT technologies like smartphone penetration spread across the world.“In small island nations, we don’t have a lot of people, but we do have a lot of people dependent on phone services and all of a sudden they’re going to have their phones on them all the time,” said Thomas Suddaby, the manager of communications at the Pacific Islands Statistics and Research Centre in Oago, Tuvalu. “It’s going to be a huge amount of usage in small islands.”Some of the reasons Pacific governments are embracing ICT are related to their own economic development. In some cases, this involves the development of new technologies. For the countries of Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tonga, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, mobile phone penetration has enabled more efficient economic growth.In addition, ICT has the potential to help develop political institutions in the region, which in turn will help to create new revenue opportunities for countries like those in the Middle East.In the case of the Solomon Islands, telecommunications are proving more useful than ever before to develop their political economy. While previously, the government used cellular telephony to manage election monitoring and to manage public protests, in recent years more sophisticated tools have proven to be more effective.“In the past we’ve used the traditional tools that were available, for instance a radio telescope or an airplane and radio nets,” said James McArdle, a senior adviser to the Solomon Islands Government and former communications minister.",

A brutal militia attack on Sunday in the South left over 100 dead. The clash in southern Sudan's Jonglei state is the latest and most fatal of a steady string of attacks in the region that the United Nations estimates has left more than 1,200 dead since the beginning of the year. The South's army has accused Khartoum of arming rival militias in the South in an effort to undermine the 2005 peace agreement, which is supposed to culminate in a 2011 referendum on independence in South Sudan. Cattle raids are traditionally common in the pastoralist areas of the south, but eyewitnesses say that many of these attacks take a much different form. They say that often these militiamen target the towns, leaving cattle untouched.These reports have driven suspicions that Khartoum has resurrected its tactic of arming proxy southern militias. During the long civil war between the two sides, the North strategically exploited tribal tensions in the south in an attempt to paralyze the South's main army.A senior communication official of the North's ruling National Congress Party, Rabie Abdulaati, denied the accusations, telling VOA that the comments from the southern officials are just an attempt to deflect blame.\"",

But the systems can also be used for the social control measures that Beijing uses to monitor political speech and crack down on dissidents.Analysts say that's exactly how some countries are already using their new equipment.\"In 2014, we documented [Chinese corporation] ZTE’s sale of telecom surveillance technology to the Ethiopian government, which used that equipment to monitor its political opponents,\" said Human Rights Watch’s China director Sophie Richardson.“As the leadership in Beijing has become more repressive domestically, China has grown more ambitious internationally in ways that are anathema to democratic values and the rule of law,” National Endowment for Democracy Vice President Christopher Walker said.As the country has become a manufacturing powerhouse and high-tech exporter, Walker says Beijing is eager to spread the surveillance technologies they are perfecting at home.\"",

Protesters began marches in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town and other big metropolitan areas to push for the resignation of the scandal-tainted Zuma, who for now retains the support of a ruling party facing an internal revolt against the president. “Fire Zuma,” read some placards. A march organized by the Democratic Alliance, South Africa’s biggest opposition party, was expected to pass near the headquarters of the ruling African National Congress in downtown Johannesburg. ANC members in military uniforms who oppose the protest were posted outside. The government appealed for calm and said it respects the right of South Africans to protest peacefully, a legacy of the struggle against white minority rule that ended in 1994 with the country’s first all-race vote and the election of Nelson Mandela as president. Pravin Gordhan, who was fired as finance minister in a late-night Cabinet reshuffle a week ago, was widely respected for his anti-corruption stance. The Standard & Poor’s agency lowered South Africa’s foreign currency credit rating after the dismissal, citing political instability and threats to economic growth.",

There is no other major piece of legislation moving through Congress.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made it clear that his focus will remain on the Republican tax cut bill, which is projected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade.\"The Senate will not waste time,\" McConnell said Tuesday, \"bobbing and weaving and second-guessing ourselves along the way.\"There is plenty of drama going on in Congress — the House Ethics Committee recommended the expulsion of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., for lying about his knowledge of sexual harassment claims against a member of his staff.That staff member, Michael Short, resigned and Ryan maintains he did nothing wrong.But it is not just the lack of legislation that is making life difficult for the GOP leadership. Another problem is that the Republican majorities in Congress are not getting very big. That makes it harder to get things done. In the Senate, Republicans currently hold 52 of the 100 seats. In the House, Republicans hold 241 seats.There are a bunch of bills that could make the Senate more partisan, but McConnell has little incentive to work on them — his top priority is the tax bill.\"His top priority for 2018 is to cut taxes for the wealthy,\" Sen.

The research, conducted by the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance, found that one in four South African women have reported being a victim of rape during their lifetime.The report also revealed that a staggering nine percent of South African men have reported being raped at least once. This figure is even higher than some of the most poverty-stricken countries, such as Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.The Alliance's research also indicates that the incidence of rape has increased significantly in recent years. This increase is mainly due to a lack of enforcement of the country's laws regarding rape, as well as a culture that frequently tolerates violence against women.The Alliance has called on the South African government to take more stringent action against perpetrators of rape, as well as to create a culture that firmly stands against violence and promotes education about gender-based violence.

He says the deal will allow the government to make investments in education, technology and infrastructure that could help the economy grow.The agreement also has some prominent critics.The chief executive of one of the world's biggest investment firms said Wednesday the deal \"darkens an already fragile outlook\" for the U.S. economy. Writing in the Financial Times, Pimco's Mohamed El-Erian warns the deal does little to reduce the country's actual deficits and postpones decisions on key issues.The major credit rating agencies are also being cautious.Moody's Investor Services said late Tuesday it will maintain the United States government's top AAA rating, but warns the outlook for the country is negative. Fitch Ratings said the risk of the U.S. defaulting on its debts remains extremely low but added it wants to see a credible plan to further reduce the U.S. budget deficit.The debt deal signed Tuesday by President Barack Obama allows the government to continue borrowing money through 2012 in exchange for spending cuts of almost $1 trillion over the next 10 years.",

John Bel Edwards told reporters at a news conference on Friday that 10% of the state's population of nearly 3 million is now under mandatory evacuation orders, which could increase even more following a weekend of heavy rain and potential flooding.Louisiana was spared the worst of Hurricane Katrina, but a series of major storms has hammered the southeastern part of the state in the years since, including Hurricane Laura, according to a report by CNN.On Thursday, the Louisiana Department of Homeland Security issued a voluntary evacuation for the Louisiana City of Monroe and all its residents on the city's north shore, a day after New Orleans lifted its mandatory evacuation orders for areas near New Orleans.In New Orleans, the city closed beaches as the storm's winds picked up and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged people to stay at home and only leave if they needed to go out to buy groceries or pick up medicine.\"In addition to our already ongoing preparations, I want to again encourage everyone to do what they can to reduce their exposure to the storm, to keep themselves safe and to provide for those we care about most,\" Cantrell said in a Thursday evening statement on social media.The damage is even worse for New Orleans. With the city's largest refinery in the state — and the largest oil market in the world — being hit by Laura, the city will not be able to pump gasoline in a pinch, CNN reported.More than 800 gas pumps in Louisiana were shut down at the start of the storm, a significant loss for a state that has the world's largest refining capacity.One day later, Louisiana's governor declared a state of emergency in seven counties where the storm hit hardest.",

The emergency court in Khartoum, which handed down the verdict on Saturday, also ordered 20 lashes for each woman but then waived the flogging, apparently giving in to pressure from the women's families rallying outside the courthouse at the time, said the Democratic Lawyers Alliance. The alliance is part of the Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella organization that has been spearheading the anti-government protests across Sudan. Hundreds of protesters have been brought before emergency courts across Sudan for speedy trials over violating a state of emergency declared by President Omar al-Bashir in late February. Sarah Abdel-Jaleel, a spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association, said the rulings against the women were part of ``a series of arbitrary sentences against peaceful protesters'' by emergency courts in the past week.",

As a result, it is responsible for an estimated $5 billion annually in profits. However, there have been growing claims that the profits are being made at the expense of human rights and ethical standards.Ivory Coast is a cash crop dependent economy, with cocoa accounting for around 40% of its exports. The government and the private sector have made efforts to enforce laws around child labour, but despite this, evidence suggests that the use of child labour in the supply chain remains widespread and often accompanied by severe abuse and exploitation. Furthermore, corruption is alleged to be rife and cocoa has been cited as being a major source of revenue for rebel groups and a contributing factor in the civil wars of recent years.These accusations have left many consumers and organisations feeling conflicted. While the country clearly has an important role to play in the production of cocoa, many are concerned about the ethical implications of supporting such a system. This has led many to question whether it is right to buy products originating from Ivory Coast, and has sparked a debate around ethics versus profit in the global economy.",

The report also suggested that workers were exposed to dangerous conditions and lacked proper safety training.Huajian Group, a key manufacturer of Ivanka Trump's shoe line, released a statement on Monday, refuting the accusations and labeling them as \"completely unfounded.\" The company said that they strictly adhere to Chinese labor laws and abide by ethical labor practices. \"We have a strong commitment to maintaining the highest ethical standards and treating our workers with dignity and respect,\" the statement read.Additionally, the company claimed that it had undergone a rigorous inspection by a third-party audit team earlier this year, which determined no labor law violations had occurred. Huajian Group also pointed out that the China Labor Watch report failed to provide any evidence supporting their claims.Despite these claims, the controversy has added fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding business ethics and labor practices of companies associated with the Trump family. Ivanka Trump's fashion brand, which was launched in 2007, has faced scrutiny for its alleged mistreatment of factory workers in both China and Indonesia.The China Labor Watch report comes in the wake of the arrest of three activists in China, who were investigating labor conditions at Huajian Group factories. The activists were detained by Chinese authorities in May, drawing international attention and raising questions about the connection between the arrests and their investigation into the Ivanka Trump fashion line.For now, the full extent of the labor violations alleged by China Labor Watch remains unclear, but the controversy has once again raised concerns about the ethics of global supply chains and the potential exploitation of workers in low-cost manufacturing countries.",

The sustainable and eco-friendly living space, dubbed \"The River Nest,\" has captured the attention of the city and may become a potential solution to the shortage of affordable housing.The River Nest is a 3,000 square foot living area created on a 90-foot long decommissioned barge. It includes four individual living units, a communal kitchen, a shared bathroom, and an impressive rooftop garden. Each living unit comes equipped with a bed, storage, and workspace, providing ample comfort for its occupants.Joe Thompson, a 35-year-old architect, was inspired to create The River Nest when he realized that the city's current housing infrastructure would not be able to cope with the increasing population demands. \"New York City has a housing crisis and, as an architect, I wanted to find a creative solution to help ease the pressure,\" Thompson explained. \"With this project, I hope to demonstrate the possibilities that exist for sustainable living on the water.\"Thompson has put a significant emphasis on sustainability in the design and construction of The River Nest. The barge uses solar panels for electricity, rainwater collection systems for water supply, and a hydroponic garden to grow food for the residents. Additionally, the living quarters are made from reclaimed materials, such as shipping containers and salvaged wood, reducing waste and keeping costs low.One of the current residents of The River Nest, Sarah Wilson, expressed her satisfaction with her new living arrangement. \"It's been a great experience living on the barge. I feel like I am part of a tight-knit community, and it's wonderful to be so close to nature,\" said Wilson. \"Plus, with the affordable rent, I can actually save money and still live in the city.\"With rent for each unit set at $600 per month, The River Nest offers a significantly more affordable option for New Yorkers compared to the average rent in the city. As the city continues to struggle with increasing rent prices and a lack of affordable housing, Thompson's innovative project has caught the attention of city officials.\"We are always looking for new and innovative solutions to address the housing crisis in New York City,\" said Mayor Brown.",

Many parishioners demanded changes in the way the church is run when they learned that church officials protected accused priests and failed to forward alleged abuse cases to law enforcement authorities.Since then, some states, including Massachusetts and New York, have passed legislation requiring clergy to report child abuse to the state.The Massachusetts attorney general's findings follow a U.S. grand jury investigation into whether leaders of the Boston Archdiocese should face criminal charges for overlooking allegations of abuse and shuffling accused priests to different parishes. He released his conclusions in a 91-page report.Attorney General Reilly said former Archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law bears ultimate responsibility for what he calls the \"tragic treatment of children.\"",

The analysis is based on 2,500 census, survey and population registers from around the world.Pew experts say they allowed for conversion rates, but maintain that birth and death rates will have a far larger impact on religious populations.Other religious groups such as Hindus and Jews are expected to grow to larger total numbers by 2060, but not at pace with total population growth. And the number of people who profess no religion is expected to shrink, given current birth rates.",

Thousands of women and men joined together in cities around the country to voice their support for the right to access abortion services.The rallies came amid the passing of new laws in states like Georgia and Alabama that seek to further restrict access to abortions. The Supreme Court recently declined to hear a challenge to a Louisiana law that would effectively limit access to abortion services in the state.The demonstrations were met with cheers and chants as demonstrators urged lawmakers to uphold a woman’s right to access abortion services and to protect access to reproductive health care services.The rallies also focused on the need to protect the Roe v. Wade decision, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling which made abortions legal in the US.Pro-choice activists said the rallies sent a clear message that they would not allow laws to dictate a woman’s right to access abortion services and would continue to fight for the right to choose.",

The Foreign Ministry released a statement yesterday criticizing the United States, France, and the United Kingdom for their stance on the Syrian conflict.The statement alleged that these countries were impeding the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria and were not allowing refugees to return to their homes. The Russian government called on these countries to change their approach and to work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.The Syrian civil war has been ongoing for over seven years, and it has resulted in the displacement of millions of people. Russia has been a vocal supporter of the Syrian government and has been providing military and diplomatic support to Damascus.The United States, France, and the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have been critical of the Russian role in the conflict and have imposed sanctions on Moscow. They have also been supporting opposition groups in Syria and have called for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.The situation in Syria remains volatile, and the conflict shows no signs of abating. The international community is struggling to find a solution to the crisis, and the Russian statement has once again highlighted the deep divisions between the West and Russia over the conflict.Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis have so far failed, and it remains to be seen whether a peaceful resolution can be achieved. The situation in Syria is likely to remain a major challenge for the international community for the foreseeable future.",
