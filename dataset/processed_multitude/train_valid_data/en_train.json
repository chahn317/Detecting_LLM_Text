VOA's Heda Bayron in Beijing tells us more.Straight from New York, the Tony-award winning \"42nd Street\" musical opened in Shanghai this month. The tap-dancing extravaganza, about a chorus girl turned big star, will tour six other Chinese cities this year.This Broadway production is the first to have such an extensive touring scheduled in China and many more blockbuster musicals are expected to follow.Broadway musicals - showcasing a lot of dancing and singing - are finding their way into theaters that have previously only showed traditional Chinese opera and patriotic dramas. Last year, Chinese audiences saw \"West Side Story\", \"The Sound of Music\" and \"The Lion King\".U.S. producers and promoters say China's market liberalization and growing prosperity are fueling demand for Western theater.Chris Verrill directs a local production of another Tony-award winner \"Guys and Dolls\" at the Beijing Playhouse. \"The next big thing that grows after the economy is the arts. And I think English-language theater, Broadway musicals and all forms of art are being raised because of that. We're sort of riding a wave,\" he said.Some foreign theater productions such as the French revolution-themed \"Les Miserables\" have been staged in China in recent years, but for limited runs.In 2005, China's Ministry of Culture allowed foreign investments into the entertainment industry, allowing the creation of joint venture theater production companies.",

He then went underground.On Wednesday, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) added his partner, Diana Espinoza Salazar, to its list of drug traffickers, saying she was an integral part of Caro Quintero's operations, according to a statement.Espinoza Salazar met Caro Quintero in prison, and she holds some of his assets under her name, the statement said. OFAC ordered her U.S. assets to be frozen.The Treasury, \"in coordination with DEA [the Drug Enforcement Administration], is committed to targeting Caro Quintero until he is brought to justice and his organization is dismantled,\" said Acting OFAC Director John E. Smith.Caro Quintero, believed to be 63, is one of the old guard of the countries' drug lords.",

It was a key agenda of three summits between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the past year.The Korean War ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war.But Moon's overture faces a backlash in Washington, where U.S. officials worry such a declaration could weaken international sanctions against the North for its nuclear weapons and missiles.North Korea has traditionally used a step-by-step approach in dealing with its rival and fears being squeezed out of the talks as a result of any rapid, multi-faceted approach.Moon, who has met twice with Kim in the past few months, is under pressure from Washington to take tangible steps toward ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\"If the two Koreas end the war and promote cooperation and integration, then I believe that North Korea will be able to obtain security and prosperity on its own,\" Moon told a packed auditorium at the Humboldt University.\"It is also my deep conviction that the two Koreas must take the lead in jointly making that vision into a reality,\" Moon said.",

(Ronald Reagan Library, Washington)Three decades after leaving the White House, Ronald Reagan is back on the campaign trail — as a hologram.The late president’s image will appear alongside President Donald Trump at a Friday rally in southern California, where the men will be presented as “a vision of the American dream,” organizers say.Holograms of Reagan and former President Abraham Lincoln were previously featured at The Reagan Library in California. The most recent iteration featured Reagan calling for a “truly national effort to build a culture of life” by reversing a “steady erosion of our morals.”“A society without morals, a society that puts profit before people, a society that embraces greed instead of gratitude, is a society that destroys itself,” Reagan says in the recording.The Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute says this year’s event will “showcase President Trump’s achievements in keeping that promise.” Trump is taking credit for an “economic boom” and low unemployment.The event will be held in the 16,000-seat Anaheim Convention Center, and $50 tickets will be made available to county GOP members, the foundation said. There will also be a smaller exhibit area for $35 a person.Trump and Reagan, who died in 2004 and 2004, respectively, are among the most popular Republican presidents among the party faithful and are often mentioned as potential nominees for the GOP.",

There is little to be done short of replacing the 430-year-old temple's gold-plated walls — an expensive project already undertaken more than a century ago and then again in 1999. To cut down on pollution, environmentalists and religious leaders have launched a campaign that includes persuading farmers to stop burning spent crops to clear their fields, removing industry from the area and cutting back on traffic. A community kitchen called a \"langar'' that serves up to 100,000 people free meals every day at the temple is also switching from burning wood to cooking with gas. But so far the campaign hasn't had much impact, with change happening slowly and still no pollution monitoring equipment installed. \"As far as pollution goes, we are paying attention,'' said Jaswant Singh, environmental engineer at the State Pollution Control Board, a government regulatory authority. \"We are in the process of procuring equipment so that we can check the pollution area, pollution from every source on a day-to-day basis.'' Officials have also banned burning trash or cooking with certain fuels in restaurants and communities nearby, but enforcement so far remains weak.",

Just a few years ago, New Mexico had one of the most serious drunk driving problems in the United States, with more alcohol-related fatalities per capita than any other state. Since then, legislators have addressed the problem with many new laws, including requiring ignition interlocks for repeat \"DWI\" (driving while intoxicated) offenders. It's basically a breath analyzer installed in the car that won't let the car be started if the driver has been drinking. The interlock requires the driver to pass a re-test at random intervals while driving, otherwise it will shut off the vehicle. It's meant to prevent people from taking a drink after they've started the car or from having a sober person start the car for someone who's been drinking.Other states have similar laws, but in 2005, New Mexico became the first to require interlocks for first-time offenders. Many officials say they're beginning to see positive results from mandatory interlock sentencing for all DWIs. Others disagree, and there have been problems with the law.Until a few years ago, Leslie Hines didn't really think twice about driving home after a few drinks or even after a few too many. But these days, that decision is out of her hands. Before she can start her car, she has to pass the interlock test. She takes a deep breath and blows into the device. A click, a beep, and a few moments later, the interlock message panel displays 'Drive Safely!'In 2004, Hines tried to drive home after a party. She got on the highway heading the wrong way without her headlights on. She says she still doesn't remember what happened.",

Asadullah Sadaat, a 26-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker, had been making his way through Europe after fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan in search of a safer and better life for himself and his family.Asadullah embarked on his journey in 2018 with high hopes, leaving behind his family and a country ravaged by conflict. After crossing several borders and traveling through Iran, Turkey, and Greece, he eventually found himself in Croatia. As he was attempting to cross into Slovenia, the unexpected happened. Asadullah was struck by a car in a hit-and-run accident, leaving him severely injured and paralyzed from the waist down.\"I was excited to start a new life, to find a job and take care of my family,\" said Asadullah, recounting his dreams and aspirations. \"But this accident has shattered my dreams, and now I find myself in a situation worse than the one I left behind in Afghanistan.\"Asadullah was treated for his injuries in a hospital in Croatia, where he spent several months recuperating. As he was unable to move on his own, Asadullah sought help from various non-governmental organizations, including the Croatian Red Cross, which provided him with a wheelchair and helped him with his physical rehabilitation.As an asylum-seeker, Asadullah is facing additional challenges. His legal status remains uncertain, with his asylum application still under review. In the meantime, he is living in a Croatian asylum center, where he receives limited support.The tragedy that befell Asadullah highlights the perils faced by refugees and asylum-seekers as they make the perilous journey to Europe. Often forced to rely on human traffickers, their journeys are fraught with danger, as they brave inhospitable terrain, harsh weather, and hostile border crossings.In the face of these difficulties, Asadullah remains hopeful for a better future. \"I want to find a job, learn the local language, and contribute to society,\" he said. \"My body may be broken, but my spirit remains unbroken. I will not give up.\"While Asadullah's dream of starting a new life may have turned into a nightmare, his story serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination exhibited by refugees and asylum-seekers.",

While it is often seen in the elderly, symptoms can begin at a much younger age. For this reason, it is important to know the early warning signs of Alzheimer's disease. The first sign to look for is a decline in memory. It may be difficult to remember recent events, conversations, or even one's own name. Another sign is difficulty communicating. This can include difficulty forming words or understanding verbal communication. In addition, a person with Alzheimer's may experience confusion when it comes to following directions or understanding unfamiliar surroundings. They may also be at a loss when asked to perform simple tasks.Other warning signs include difficulty finding the right word when speaking or writing, impaired judgment, changes in mood or behavior, difficulty with abstract thinking, and reduced visuospatial skills. It is important to remember that not everyone with these symptoms will have Alzheimer's. However, if you are experiencing any of the above, it is important to speak to a doctor for an evaluation. Early diagnosis and treatment can be very beneficial.",

However, the road to recovery is far from smooth for these individuals, who have been subjected to years of abuse and trauma.Many of the liberated captives are now struggling to survive in displacement camps, where they face a lack of basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care. The psychological trauma of their experiences is also taking its toll, with many struggling to come to terms with what they have been through.\"I was enslaved by Boko Haram for three years,\" said one liberated captive, who asked to remain anonymous. \"I witnessed things that no person should ever have to see.

Senator Graham urged the CIA to declassify portions of its intelligence so that the public can make a better determination on whether or not the Iraq invasion was necessary.

The three leaders are expected to discuss the security situation in the region and how they can work together to ensure the region is safe.Museveni has said several terrorist groups are active in the region.According to the Ugandan government, many of these groups are financed and armed by foreign intelligence agencies to destabilize the region and fight western interests.The militants and terrorists have targeted foreign nationals in their attacks in the past weeks.The Ugandan foreign ministry said they expect Museveni and other regional leaders to develop a strategy to counter terrorists that may be active in their countries.\"Our region has witnessed a resurgence of political violence and terrorist attacks,\" the ministry said. \"The summit provides a platform for leaders to explore the drivers of this resurgence and agree on a joint strategy to combat terrorism.\"Uganda said the summit is an important platform to deal with the security situation in the region. They said the summit will also explore the economic opportunities in the region and how they can be boosted through the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement.\"The summit will discuss issues of regional peace and security, especially in light of the increasing terrorist attacks in neighboring countries,\" the ministry added. \"We anticipate that this summit will lay the foundation for further cooperation between the three countries and chart a sustainable path towards the realization of their development aspirations.\"The summit comes weeks after Uganda's opposition leader, Bobi Wine, announced he is running for president in elections due in January.",

The Taliban had openly threatened Malala Yousafzai. A gunman shot Malala Yousafzai, seriously wounding her and injuring at least one other girl Tuesday as they were leaving school. Yousafazi started writing about Taliban atrocities in Pakistan's northwest when she was just 11 years old. She wrote under the pseudonym of Gul Makai, in a blog published by the BBC. Pakistan Prime Minister Raza Pervez Ashraf lashed out against the attack. \"We have to set aside differences over minor issues and collectively condemn and continue our fight against the extremist mindset behind this attack,\" said Ashraf. \"If that mindset prevails then, be it Malala or any other daughter of this country will not be safe.\" Ashraf said as soon as he had heard about the shooting, he sent a helicopter to take Yousafzai, 14, to a hospital. Speaking to parliament, the prime minister said he had ordered authorities to immediately investigate the incident. Local news reports said President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack and insisted it would not deter Pakistan from eliminating extremism and terrorism.",

The opposition maintained that its leader, Nelson Chamisa, defeated current President Emmerson Mnangagwa.About 150 demonstrators gathered Wednesday afternoon outside the offices of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). Police tried to disperse the protesters using water cannons and tear gas.

Experts from various sectors, including technology, law, and consumer advocacy, were invited to share their views on the possible steps the government can take to curb data breaches and establish more robust privacy safeguards.In her opening remarks, Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) emphasized the urgency of formulating a national privacy framework, given the escalating number of data breaches and privacy violations in recent years. She also stated that the lack of a comprehensive federal law has put the onus on individual states to address privacy concerns, leading to a disjointed approach.\"The need to have basic federal privacy protections for consumers is long overdue,\" said Cantwell. \"We must ensure that consumers have control over their personal information and that companies are held accountable for safeguarding this data.\"During the hearing, several lawmakers acknowledged the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as noteworthy models to be considered while drafting the US privacy law. However, many agreed that it was crucial to establish a distinct American framework that takes into account the country's unique challenges and requirements.The testimony from experts revolved around the key components of privacy legislation, such as data collection and processing limitations, robust enforcement mechanisms, and transparency in corporate practices. Some of the panelists also addressed the issue of preemption, noting that a federal law should strike a balance between providing uniformity and respecting the autonomy of individual states.While the lawmakers and experts acknowledged the potential economic benefits of effectively utilizing consumer data, they also highlighted the need to protect civil liberties and individual privacy rights. Furthermore, concerns about the monopolistic behavior of large technology companies were also raised, with participants calling for stronger antitrust enforcement to ensure a level playing field for businesses of all sizes.As the hearing concluded, lawmakers expressed their intent to continue working on drafting a comprehensive privacy bill, signaling a growing consensus on the issue in the Senate. Although the timeline for the introduction of the legislation remains uncertain, the open hearing signifies a significant step forward in the quest to secure the personal data of millions of Americans.",

The common origin of all those languages, scientists say, must be somewhere on the European continent.

A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with official policy, said authorities were investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.His death came two weeks after the student was dragged off a moving bus with a male friend by six men, one of whom police said raped her and then had the friend beaten, and set off a public outrage over rampant crime and the prevalence of sexual assault in India.As protests over the Dec. 16 attack grew, government responded by promising stronger laws, tougher penalties and setting up a task force to advise on issues of violence against women.But the gang rape suspect's death, while widely anticipated by supporters of the victim, raised a new set of concerns in India, which has the highest number of reported rape cases in the world, many of which don't result in prosecutions.Critics pointed to it as proof of the government's failed efforts to improve safety for women — a promise Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called \"a collective shame of the society.\"The victim's father, Badrinath Singh, said he would only speak with the government after he gets the full details of the case, including how his daughter's alleged attacker killed himself.\"They will not give me proper answers.

The congress is likely to last several days. In the past, the event drew many delegates from around the world.In 1980, nearly 180 delegates from 118 countries attended the gathering. This time, the North is known to have invited only a handful of foreign delegates to the event. Despite the low profile, the congress will give Kim an opportunity to assume center stage before a large domestic audience, including more than 3,000 delegates from around the nation. The gathering comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula following Pyongyang’s fourth nuclear test in January.Kim is expected to make major policy announcements during the gathering, although what Kim might announce remains unclear. Kim took power in late 2011, when his father and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il died suddenly. Some analysts said the congress is likely to be more of a symbolic procedure to elevate Kim’s status, noting Kim has already taken top posts in the party and military.“The congress has been largely a scripted event so I really wouldn’t expect anything new,” James Person, deputy director for the history and public policy program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said at an event in Washington on Tuesday.“",

They are far more interested in politics than they are in helping the people. No deal!\"The Democrats have been pushing for a \"clean\" DACA fix, without any additional border security measures or funding for the President's border wall.

The arrests, which occurred throughout Florida on July 25, were the result of an extensive multi-agency undercover investigation led by Broward Sheriff's Office Detective Michael Nolte.\"These are individuals who we believe are professionals,\" Nolte said. \"Each one of them has a target store and a route they hit during their shift. All day, and often several times a day, they are driving, walking, and watching for potential targets.\"\"They have several people working the same area, so they are often successful at distracting the store's loss prevention officers, keeping them busy in other areas of the store, and giving the ring members a chance to flee the store with stolen goods,\" Nolte explained.Most of the shoplifting incidents involve the thefts of video games and movies, but according to law enforcement sources, the organized ring is also responsible for large amounts of stolen electronics and other merchandise, valued between $500 and $3,000, that were stolen during a coordinated daytime robbery of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in several South Florida counties, including Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Indian River, Martin, St. Lucie, and Okeechobee.According to law enforcement sources, the thefts at the stores are carried out by two types of people: The \"walkers\" are shoplifters who take items from the store and attempt to get away without being arrested. They generally have the items hidden in a bag when they leave the store, and are normally arrested when they're seen getting into their cars or when they're seen dumping the merchandise nearby. The \"runners\" are actually paid employees of the ring who are sent to the store to steal items. They're often seen walking out of the store with the stolen merchandise in hand.",

The US State Department has called on the Venezuelan government to respect democratic principles and protect the rights of its citizens, including those in opposition.Several opposition figures, some of whom are former military officials, have recently faced legal charges in Venezuela for allegedly plotting a coup against the current President Nicolas Maduro. Critics of the government, including prominent figures within the Venezuelan opposition, have accused Maduro of using these allegations to suppress political dissent and further consolidate his power.US State Department spokesperson Ned Price stated that the United States is \"deeply concerned\" by the ongoing harassment, detention, and prosecution of those who disagree with the Venezuelan government. He urged the Maduro regime to \"immediately release all political prisoners, end the harassment of its citizens, and respect fundamental human rights and democratic principles.\"Price also highlighted that the recent prosecutions are part of a broader pattern of political repression in Venezuela. He cited several instances where former Chavez opponents and critics of the Maduro government have been arrested or charged with dubious crimes. This includes the 2019 arrest of opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó, whose claim to the presidency was supported by the US and several other nations.These actions by the Venezuelan government have drawn widespread condemnation from the international community. Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have documented cases of arbitrary detention, torture, and persecution against political opponents in Venezuela.The US has been a vocal critic of President Maduro's administration since he took office in 2013 following the death of Hugo Chavez. Maduro's government has been accused of economic mismanagement, human rights abuses, and undermining the democratic institutions of the country. In response to these concerns, the US has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela and offered support to opposition figures like Guaidó.In light of the recent prosecution of Chavez's foes, the US has reiterated its commitment to promote democracy and human rights in Venezuela and called on its allies to do the same. The continued pressure from the international community aims to encourage the Venezuelan government to address these issues and restore the rule of law in the country.However, the Maduro government has consistently denied these allegations and dismissed the criticism as foreign interference.",

In a series of tweets on Sunday, the president expressed frustration with the current immigration system, arguing that those who enter the country unlawfully should be immediately deported without legal proceedings.\"Why are we having all these people from Sh*thole Countries come here? We must BUILD THE WALL, add more Border Patrol agents, change our ridiculous Immigration Laws, and have Merit Based Immigration,\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"We don't want people who will be a public charge or crime threat. We want great people who will work hard, pay taxes, and contribute to the American Dream.\"The president's comments come as his administration continues to face significant backlash over its \"zero tolerance\" policy, which has led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. In recent weeks, the administration has struggled to reunify families and meet court-imposed deadlines for doing so.Despite criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as human rights organizations and international leaders, Trump has repeatedly defended his administration's hardline stance on immigration. The president argues that the current system is flawed and that individuals who cross the border illegally should be held accountable for breaking the law.However, critics argue that the president's proposals – which include eliminating legal proceedings for illegal border crossers – would violate the due process rights guaranteed by the US Constitution. Additionally, many experts contend that bypassing the court system could lead to wrongful deportations and further strain US relations with its southern neighbors.Trump's insistence on a merit-based immigration system also remains a contentious issue. While the president argues that such a system would ensure the US only accepts the best and brightest immigrants, opponents say it would unfairly exclude many individuals who could contribute positively to American society.As the debate over immigration policy continues to dominate headlines and drive political discourse, it remains to be seen what steps the Trump administration will take to address the ongoing crisis at the border. In the meantime, thousands of families remain separated, and countless more await their fate as they face an uncertain future in the United States.",

Among the key proposals are the expansion of income-based repayment plans and the introduction of a new loan forgiveness program for public sector workers.According to Obama, the measures are part of a broader effort to ensure that everyone has access to affordable education. \"We need to make sure that students aren't saddled with debt for the rest of their lives,\" he said.The announcement was welcomed by many in the education community, who have long been advocating for changes to the student loan system. \"These measures will go a long way in alleviating the burden faced by millions of students across the country,\" said John Doe, President of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.However, not everyone is convinced that Obama's proposals go far enough. Some have criticized the President for not doing more to address the root causes of the student loan crisis, such as rising tuition fees and a lack of government funding for higher education.Despite the criticisms, Obama remains optimistic that his changes will make a real difference for students. \"I believe that with these measures, we can help more Americans achieve their dreams of getting a college education and building a better future for themselves and their families,\" he said.",

The report says an unjustified Georgian military strike on breakaway South Ossetia sparked the war with Russia. But it says Russia fomented tensions in the area and its subsequent response went beyond the limits of defensive military operations. The EU sponsored report lays the blame for the five-day war on both sides. It finds Georgia started the war last year, but only after months of provocation by Russia.The report also accuses Georgian, Russian and South Ossetian fighters of violating international humanitarian law. It cites instances of summary executions and the burning and looting of South Ossetian villages populated by ethnic Georgians and says that investigators found no evidence to support allegations of genocide against Ossetians.The report also accuses Russia of failing to prevent or stop violations by South Ossetian forces and armed paramilitaries after a ceasefire agreement.Georgia's ambassador to the EU, Salome Samadashvili, says the report \"proves\" Georgia was invaded.\"The report has proven that it was Georgia which came under invasion by the foreign state, that the sovereign country was invaded by our neighboring country in violation of the international law,\" said Samadashvili. \"The report has found that the pretexts which were given by our neighbor for invading our sovereign territory were, in fact, blatant lies. The report has proven that at no point has Georgia engaged in the campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide as it was claimed by the Russian.\"",

Saudi forces said they intercepted the missile fired at the power plant.Saudi Arabia on Thursday accused Iran of supplying the missile fired at Riyadh. Tehran denied the claim, although the U.N. said there are indications it may have supplied weapons to the rebels.A coalition statement said the missile came from Iran, the Houthis’ top regional ally, and was fired in violation of a 2015 Security Council resolution banning the supply of weapons to the rebel movement.It “remains our right to respond against this hostile act, by all available means,” the statement read.The Yemeni rebels said the missiles were fired to mark the anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition airstrike that killed more than 140 people at a funeral in Sanaa in 2016.A U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted three missile launches Sunday by the rebels, and a U.S. defense official warned that Washington will support the Saudis if they decide to take “direct military action” against Iran.Saudi Arabia and the United States accuse Iran of giving the rebels the missile that targeted the airport.

According to Erdogan, Turkey’s deployment of the S-400 is “a done deal”, and any future meetings with Trump should focus on how the two nations can resolve the dispute without creating lasting damage to their diplomatic relationship.Despite Erdogan’s public overtures, the US has remained firm in its commitment to halt F-35 production if Turkey does not remove the S-400 system. The US has argued that Turkey’s deployment of the S-400 creates a security risk to NATO allies, and could expose sensitive US military technology to Russia. Turkey has argued that the S-400 is necessary for national security, and that the US should take steps to ensure Turkey’s NATO allies do not pose a threat to its sovereignty.The US has offered to sell the Patriot missile defense system to Turkey as an alternative to the S-400, but has not made any firm commitments to allow Turkey to purchase the system. Erdogan has rejected the Patriot offer as insufficient, arguing that the system does not possess the same capabilities as the S-400.For now, the future of US-Turkish relations remain uncertain, as both sides have yet to find a resolution to the dispute.",

But we are going to keep the families together,” he said.A view inside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facility shows children at Rio Grande Valley Centralized Processing Center in Rio Grande City, Texas, June 17, 2018.Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica.The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats.“We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings.",

This form of government is defined as one which upholds the basic principles of democracy, such as free and fair elections, but does not follow the liberal standards of protecting minority rights and checks on government power.Many people fear that the rise of illiberal democracies could lead to the erosion of liberal values and lead to repressive and authoritarian policies. In Hungary, the government of Viktor Orbán has cracked down on democratic institutions, and has faced allegations of violating human rights and freedom of the press. In Poland, the government of Jarosław Kaczyński has taken a similar approach.However, despite the rhetoric of some leaders, illiberal democracies do not necessarily constitute a threat to Europe as a whole. Despite their often-flawed democratic systems, the countries which have embraced illiberal democracy remain stable and democratic in nature. The rise of illiberal democracies may reflect a growing skepticism of liberalism in European countries. As such, it does not necessarily threaten the survival of democracy, but instead demonstrates the diversity of values across Europe.",

So she packed her car, and drove six hours to volunteer for former Michigan state lawmaker Rashida Tlaib’s Congressional campaign on election day. “As a Muslim American, as an Arab American, as a Palestinian American… I’m her, she’s me,” she told VOA during a break in distributing Tlaib’s campaign literature outside a polling station.

But that law has come under repeated challenges from sighted masseurs who say it is unfair. With another legal challenge looming, some say it’s time for the blind to find new careers. Café More might be the only coffee shop in Seoul with a Braille menu. It is not just for visually impaired customers, but also the staff. Lee Seong-ju, 34, has worked here for two years and admits the job does have its challenges. She says it was difficult at first to measure the water in the coffee machine. When making an Americano she couldn't tell how high the water level was. But after a while, Lee says she learned to get the feel of it. Café More is part of a government-funded training program that gives the blind new career options. For decades, South Korea’s visually impaired have relied on a constitutional provision that allows them to work exclusively in the massage business. Now that law is once again being challenged by sighted masseurs. The last time this happened the blind took to the street to protect their privilege. In 2008 demonstrations were held in front of the nation’s highest court. Judges ruled in favor of the blind, overturning an earlier decision that took away their privilege. Later this year, the courts will again have to decide if protecting the rights of the minority outweighs the rights of the majority.",

The findings suggest that efforts to control outbreaks of bird flu may need to be reevaluated to account for the possibility of widespread drug resistance.While there are other medications available to treat bird flu, Tamiflu is often used as a first-line treatment due to its effectiveness and availability.

While attention has been focused on major cities, the Ogiek's claims of marginalization and victimization remain largely unheard.

The report said that Iran had remained within the limits set by the deal on all nuclear-related activities.The landmark nuclear agreement was negotiated in 2015 by Iran and a group of countries known as the P5+1 (the United States, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia, plus Germany). It was intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, in exchange for relief from international economic sanctions.The IAEA report came at a critical juncture for the agreement, as the United States, which unilaterally pulled out of the accord in 2018, seeks to pressure Iran into renegotiating the terms of the deal. The U.S. has reimposed sanctions on Iran, but the other countries that are party to the deal have kept the agreement alive.The IAEA report is seen as a confirmation that Iran is sticking to the agreement, despite the U.S.'s withdrawal and the reimposition of sanctions. The report also said that Iran had remained within the parameters of the deal with regard to the storage and production of enriched uranium, and had not exceeded the deal's limits on nuclear activities.While the IAEA report represents an important milestone, the agreement's future is still uncertain.

The event is expected to attract large crowds of football fans from across Africa, creating a potential market for traffickers to exploit.According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Angola is a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking, with many victims being forced into sex work or labor. The influx of visitors for the football tournament is likely to exacerbate this already-existing problem.Human rights organizations are calling on the Angolan government to take action to prevent human trafficking during the tournament, including strengthening border controls and increasing awareness campaigns among the public. They also urge football fans to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.While the African Cup of Nations is an exciting event for football fans across the continent, it is essential to consider the potential risks and take measures to prevent exploitation and trafficking.

The denial follows recent accusations from several countries, including the United States and Saudi Arabia, who have long expressed concerns over Iran's influence in the region.In recent years, Yemen has been plagued by a devastating civil war between the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition supporting the Yemeni government. The ongoing conflict has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands and has left millions on the brink of famine. Despite the severity of the situation, little progress has been made in resolving the crisis, with both sides unable to reach a peaceful resolution.The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Saeed Khatibzadeh, dismissed the allegations of supporting the Houthi rebels as \"baseless\" and insisted that Iran is committed to a political resolution in Yemen. \"Iran believes that the solution to the crisis in Yemen is only political, and we have always been ready to cooperate in this regard,\" Khatibzadeh stated. He went on to accuse the Saudi-led coalition of undermining peace efforts in the region.Iran's denial of backing the Houthi rebels comes at a time when the United States is actively reviewing its policy towards Iran, including reconsidering the previous administration's decision to leave the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The denial may be seen as an attempt by Iran to distance itself from the conflict in Yemen in order to strengthen its position in the international arena.Analysts believe that the allegations against Iran are based on intelligence reports suggesting that Tehran has been supplying the Houthi rebels with weapons, including missiles and drones, which the rebels have used to target Saudi Arabian cities and oil facilities.",

The annual event, which holds significant religious importance for Christians, saw a massive influx of worshippers this year, following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.Starting from the early hours of the morning, the procession, led by religious leaders, began at Jerusalem's Old City, moving through the narrow cobblestone alleyways of Via Dolorosa. It is believed that this 14-station route marks the path Jesus walked, carrying the cross, towards his crucifixion. Pilgrims in the procession carried wooden crosses and sang hymns, while many others prayed at the stations along the way.The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed to be the site where Jesus was crucified, buried, and resurrected, was the focal point of the pilgrimage. Devout Christians from various countries and denominations gathered here, eager to attend the special Good Friday service.Jerusalem authorities worked diligently to ensure that this year's pilgrimage would proceed smoothly while adhering to necessary COVID-19 safety measures. The vaccination campaign in Israel, which currently boasts one of the world's highest vaccination rates, has allowed authorities to ease restrictions on gatherings, enabling the event to take place.Last year, the streets of the Old City were deserted on Good Friday, as the pandemic forced religious sites to close their doors and celebrations were limited to a few dozen locals and clergy. This year, however, the event saw pilgrims from around the world returning in droves.\"It's a great blessing to be here, especially after a year of lockdowns and restrictions,\" said Michael, a pilgrim from Nigeria, adding that the experience of walking the path Jesus took over 2,000 years ago was indescribable.As Good Friday comes to an end, the faithful now prepare for Easter Sunday, marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the conclusion of the holy week.",

Sharia law, which has been adopted by twelve northern Nigerian states since 1999, has attracted both international and domestic criticism for its strict and punitive measures.The Nigerian constitution does not impose a particular religion on its citizens and guarantees the freedom to practice any faith. However, the adoption of Sharia law in the predominantly Muslim northern states has raised concerns over the infringement of individual rights and the potential division of the country along religious lines. The contentious debate resurfaced this week as legal and human rights groups took up the case of a Nigerian woman, Safiya Hussaini, who was sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery.The international community, including human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Women's Rights Advocates, has strongly condemned the verdict. These groups argue that the punishments meted out under Sharia law are both inhumane and disproportionate, particularly when it comes to women who are often subjected to harsh penalties for alleged moral crimes. Many critics also argue that such punishments are in direct violation of Nigeria's constitution as well as international human rights norms.At the national level, Nigerian civil society groups and the media have also raised their voices against the death sentence, highlighting a broader concern about the growing influence of religious extremism in the region. Some southern Nigerian states, which are predominantly Christian, have expressed deep concern over the expansion of Sharia law and its potential implications for social cohesion and national unity.The Nigerian government has been cautious in its response to the issue, with President Olusegun Obasanjo stating that the federal government has no intention of interfering with the implementation of Sharia law. Nevertheless, it appears that the Nigerian judiciary is taking a more assertive stance on the matter. The country's highest court recently overturned a lower court ruling that allowed a divorced woman to be flogged for adultery, arguing that such punishment was unconstitutional.As the debate over the fairness and constitutionality of Sharia law continues to rage in Nigeria, it is clear that this issue has far-reaching implications for the country's political stability, social cohesion, and adherence to international human rights norms. The upcoming appeal of Safiya Hussaini's case, which is set for March 18, will not only decide her fate but will also likely influence the broader debate over the role of religion in Nigerian law and society.",

The lake which sits in the basin is shared by Nigeria and its neighbours.A U.N. report shows that the Boko Haram has displaced more than two million people from their homes in the Lake Chad Basin region. This is almost as many as those affected by the war in Syria.The Lake Chad Basin is home to about 40 million people and supports a large, integrated and multi-sectoral economy. Its economy depends mainly on agriculture, fishing and livestock.About 70 per cent of the lake's surface area is covered by shallow sand, while the rest is deeper waters. The water area supports a variety of fish species, making fishing a key livelihood and food security strategy for millions of people.The basin's rich soils and favourable climate make it one of the largest breadbaskets in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated to produce over 1.8 million tonnes of cereals a year, as well as millions of tonnes of millet, sorghum, yams and root crops.Despite its potential, it has been plagued by Boko Haram violence and is in need of urgent help to provide urgent relief and recovery for communities.The insurgency has devastated communities that are already among the poorest and most vulnerable in the region. They are often overlooked in national development strategies, and their needs have historically been underfunded.The Lake Chad Basin area also contributes greatly to global food security and climate change mitigation as one of the largest and most carbon-rich wetlands in the Sahel.",
