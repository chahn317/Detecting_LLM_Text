The United Nations estimates more than 3 million people in the Horn of Africa face dire conditions. The situation has worsened with rising food costs and conflicts in the sub-region.“It is very serious. Several different trends have come together. One is climate change and great uncertainty and changes in the rainfall. The second is the increased cost of foodstuff. The third is the fact that the worldwide food system is drastically stretched beyond anything anyone has known in a generation.”MacCormack was in Ethiopia visiting drought-stricken regions and to discuss the humanitarian situation in the country with authorities. He said, what he saw in southern Ethiopia was that severe hunger has expanded the number of people who need emergency assistance.“",

If the fighting does resume, many are asking what next? Russia and China have blocked action by the United Nation Security Council. The Obama administration has offered humanitarian assistance and communications equipment. But while visiting a refugee camp in Turkey this week, U.S. Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman said the Annan plan is failing, and called for arming the opposition. \"The only way to reverse this situation is by helping the Syrian opposition to change the military balance of power on the ground,\" said McCain.Some in the opposition say that neither diplomacy nor military force alone will bring down the Assad government. Ammar Abdulhamid says they must be used together. \"When there is an actual threat of force or force being used, I think then we might see the possibility of the Assads listening because they can see a threat,\" Abdulhamid added. \"They can see the seriousness of the international community.",

Adam Schiff (D-CA), the top-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to resign from his congressional office for claiming that he had evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.Schiff has repeatedly made comments to reporters that he had seen direct evidence of the Russian’s hacking the November election for Trump, but on Monday he admitted he was bluffing and has seen nothing of the kind.Schiff admitted as much during an interview with the Associated Press, saying that he had no evidence of collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign but he felt that it was the “majority view” that collusion did happen.“I’m still waiting,” Rep. Schiff said. “I haven’t seen any evidence of collusion yet.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) (AP Photo)The Trump administration quickly seized on this admission and noted that Rep. Schiff had been caught lying about the collusion story.“Congressman Schiff ought to resign,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told The Washington Times. “He’s been talking with such authority about this subject. And yet he really now has egg on his face.”But Rep. Schiff is not taking back his claims or apologizing for his false claims. Instead, the Democrat is defending his unsupported assertions saying that he was only “expressing his view” when he spoke to reporters.“The problem is there is nothing there,” said former CIA agent and conservative talker Buck Sexton.Still, when he appeared on CNN’s New Day, host Chris Cuomo did not call Rep. Schiff on his false claims but instead asked the congressman what he wanted to do with the Russia issue now that he said he had no evidence.“The question is what more do we need to do?” Schiff wondered.",

Then they add aerobic exercises that get the heart and lungs to work harder and promote circulation.Ball says adults need at lease 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week. \"You don't have to do all of your exercise in one setting.

VOA's Jeffrey Young explores how these third party candidates have nonetheless influenced the outcome of elections.In 1992, Democratic Party presidential candidate Bill Clinton defeated the incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush, the father of President George W. Bush, by nearly six million votes. But a so-called third party candidate, Ross Perot, received almost 20 million votes. Many political observers say the votes cast for Perot clearly affected the outcome of the contest between Mr. Bush and Mr.Clinton.The United States has two major political parties, the Democratic and the Republican. But there are others, such as the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the Socialist Party. These and other third parties have never succeeded in winning the White House. The reason for that is the structure of the Electoral College that actually selects the president.Benjamin Ginsberg at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C. says, \"We don't actually have one national election. We have 50 statewide [presidential] elections that are held on the same day. And in each state, Electoral College votes are allocated, usually to the candidate that wins the most votes in that state.\"Ralph Nader ran under the Green Party banner in 1996 and 2000 and also ran unaffiliated in 2004. He says the problem for third parties goes beyond the Electoral College. \"The system does not encourage, because it doesn't have proportional representation [and] doesn't have instant-runoff voting. It does not encourage multi-party development.While third party candidates may not win, they have been accused of being so-called spoilers.",

The conservatives reportedly blocked al-Erian when he was nominated.Hisham Kassem, editor of the popular Egyptian daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm, says that the internal debate over al-Erian's appointment means the pendulum of power has swung in favor of the conservatives. \"There is a rift, coming out to the surface,\" he said. \"It's always existed between the hardliners and the moderates, and clearly the hardliners are getting their way.

The technology is based on clues known by the user and the environment as well as on weather, traffic and human behavior data to predict weather patterns in real time. The technology is an expansion of the Explorer Project announced in July. In the near future, the tool is expected to support activities that include \"climate literacy,\" such as weather forecasting, and weather-related research. In the future, the technology can also facilitate planning, weather education, and disaster prevention.Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are launching an open source digital tool that will allow anyone to predict the weather in a variety of ways, including predicting the exact temperature of a user's home or an area around them.The tool — a collaboration with the MIT Media Lab and the university's Explorers Explorations Program — is currently in an exploratory phase, and will enable the public to create their own data sets for the tool.The tool is being released by the media lab in collaboration with MIT and the Explorers Explorations Program. The Explorers Explorations Program is a science and engineering program at MIT that challenges students and faculty to solve problems that advance STEM learning in the school system.The MIT team said they want the tool to be used for a variety of applications, not just weather.\"We hope that this new tool will eventually be used to help our students and researchers be more prepared for natural disasters, disaster planning, and climate change, as well as assist them in navigating the environment for the first time. This tool, along with our other Explorers programs in science, engineering and technology, is designed to empower students with the skills to make an impact in our world.\"The Explorations Team has an agenda of supporting STEM and environmental education, the team said.

It’s not only Tehran that is facing a water crisis.

        "text": "In a shocking revelation, recent investigations have uncovered a multitude of child sex abuse cases within the military that have been shielded by an opaque military justice system. This disheartening discovery has raised serious concerns about the accountability and transparency of the military legal system.Victims and advocates have long claimed that the military's handling of sexual assault cases has been marred by a culture of secrecy and an inclination to protect perpetrators at the expense of survivors. The investigations conducted by various media outlets reveal that the problem is far more entrenched and widespread than previously acknowledged.According to these investigations, the military justice system has a long history of allowing sexual predators to escape punishment by utilizing loopholes and obscure procedures. As a result, the perpetrators have been able to continue their careers, often in high-ranking positions, with little to no consequences.Data obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests has shown that thousands of child sex abuse allegations have been reported within the military community, involving both service members and family members. The numbers reveal that the military has a disproportionate rate of child sex abuse cases when compared to the civilian population, yet convictions remain minimal.Moreover, the military's opaque legal system, coupled with a lack of public records, makes it difficult to accurately track these cases and hold the offenders accountable. For instance, the military's closed court-martial records do not provide case details, which leads to inadequate reporting and public oversight.Survivors of child sexual abuse in military families face additional barriers when seeking justice and support. These families are often stationed far away from their support networks and can struggle to access adequate resources. Additionally, military families are frequently relocated, which can lead to the loss of essential evidence and witnesses, thereby weakening the cases against perpetrators.In light of these revelations, calls have been growing to reform the military justice system to ensure better protection for child sexual abuse victims. Advocates argue that several changes are needed, such as increased transparency in court-martial proceedings and the implementation of a comprehensive reporting system.Furthermore, some suggest that the military should adopt the civilian legal system's practice of mandatory reporting of child sex abuse allegations, which would require mandatory training for all service members on recognizing and reporting abuse.The recent investigations have sparked a renewed public outcry for justice and the need for a systematic overhaul of the military justice system to protect the most vulnerable. It remains to be seen whether these findings will prompt long-awaited reforms and bring much-needed accountability and transparency to the military community.",

VOA's Barry Newhouse reports from Islamabad, where the interior ministry said the death toll has reached 53 people, including four foreigners. The top official in the interior ministry told reporters that the attackers had built a sophisticated bomb that is the largest on record in Pakistan. Rehman Malik said an estimated 600 kilograms of military grade explosives were mixed with aluminum powder - a highly flammable material. The bomb was packed inside a large dump truck that was also carrying construction materials - apparently to take advantage of city rules that allow large construction vehicles into the city after sunset.Security camera footage released by officials showed a large truck attempting to ram the hotel gate. When the truck failed to breach the barrier, the driver appeared to detonate a small explosion inside the cab, catching the vehicle on fire and sending hotel guards fleeing. The vehicle then burned for several minutes, before the flames grew and eventually detonated the truck's massive payload. Rehman Malik said officials have made no arrests, but suspect the perpetrators are linked to previous attacks. \"Unless I investigate, Im not at liberty to tell you who has done it. But previous investigations, all the roads have gone to South Waziristan,\" Malik said. The tribal agency on the Afghan border is considered a stronghold of Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, who was also blamed in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.",

Experts say it is too early to tell whether or not the campaign has been effective.Military combat is not the only way Washington hopes to overcome Iraqi troops. The U.S. military also has been busy trying to persuade Iraqis to give themselves up voluntarily through a psychological operations, or psy-ops, campaign.Part of the campaign involves propaganda radio messages, as well as e-mail and telephone calls to unit commanders inviting them to negotiate their surrenders. Another important component is the dropping of millions of leaflets into Iraq. Some urge Iraqi troops to surrender or face possible destruction. Others tell ordinary civilians not to hurt their own economic futures by damaging oil fields.Brigadier General Vincent Brooks says the psy-ops campaign this time has been more intense than during the first Gulf war in 1991. \"That accounts for roughly five million more [leaflets] than all of which were dropped in Desert Storm,\" he says. \"Each one of them has a different theme. It's targeted to specific areas -- whether it's to a unit or to the population.\"The obvious question is has this psy-ops campaign been effective?Professor Jerrold Post, director of George Washington University's Political Psychology Program, says it is too early to say. \"I think it's important to recall what happened in 1991,\" he says.",

The only red light: higher fuel prices among Vietnam's consumers.Vietnam, though not a major oil-producing nation like much of the Middle East, has counted energy-related commodities as its fifth highest source of exports. The industry is largely state-owned, including energy supplier PetroVietnam, with $3.1 billion in annual sales. Much of Vietnam’s energy comes from under the seas off its east and south coasts.If crude oil prices hold at an average $65 per barrel this year, above last year’s average of US$60, economic growth will exceed the 6.7 percent target set by the legislature, the Communist Party of Vietnam’s website said last week.“Vietnam has a huge level of natural gas reserves and a level of oil, so if the prices go up that would definitely be a boon for Vietnam,” said Ralf Matthaes, founder of the Infocus Mekong Research consultancy in Ho Chi Minh City.“It would be another benefit for Vietnam, that look, Vietnam has more exports. It’s not just about coffee and rice,” he said.The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance forecasts that total state revenue from crude oil exports will reach $3.13 billion in the first nine months of 2018, up 42.5% over the same period last year. The total for January through September would beat a full-year target.The revenue increases for Vietnam reflect higher income from oil sales worldwide.

While none of these are new for Russia, what is surprising is that they have gotten so much worse under Putin.Although Putin is far more disciplined than the man who anointed him -- Boris Yeltsin, a heavy drinker who came to personify Russia’s loss of status following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 -- the system Putin has put in place is, Feifer writes, “far more corrupt and inequitable … than anything seen under Yeltsin.”While Moscow dazzles with new restaurants, boutiques and nightclubs patronized by a privileged elite, the countryside crumbles and the business environment is increasingly distorted by corruption. According to Feifer, the bribes ordinary businessmen must pay simply to operate have increased more than six-fold from an average $23,000 a year when Putin took office to $135,000.",

So strange that scientists dubbed it the Tully Monster, after Francis Tully, the amateur fossil hunter who discovered it in 1958 in the central United States. Now a group of researchers from Yale University may have finally answered some questions about this evolutionary oddity, officially known as Tullimonstrum gregarium. Their results are published in today’s issue of the journal Nature and offer the clearest picture yet as to what this 300-million-year-old sea creature was all about. \"I was first intrigued by the mystery of the Tully Monster. With all of the exceptional fossils, we had a very clear picture of what it looked like, but no clear picture of what it was,\" said lead author Victoria McCoy. An Ocean Dwelling Nightmare The creature certainly looked like a monster: its teeth and mouth were placed at the end of a long trunk-like neck that looked more like a claw than a mouth. And even stranger, its eyes were placed just above its midsection on either side of its body at the end of what looks like a curtain rod laid across its back. It only grew to a third of a meter. But while they may have looked strange, they were prolific; scientists have recovered thousands of Tully Monster fossils. For years, scientists have been puzzled not only by its appearance, but by where this unusual swimmer actually belonged in terms of lineage - was it a mollusk, or a fish, or something else entirely? \"Basically, nobody knew what it was,\" said co-author Derek Briggs, from Yale.",

In a statement released on Monday, Amnesty called on the ICC to leave no stone unturned in its pursuit of accountability for the heinous crimes perpetrated by the group.Boko Haram, which has been active in Nigeria since 2009, is known for its brutal acts of violence, including mass kidnappings, bombings, and executions. According to Amnesty International, the group has killed more than 30,000 people and displaced over two million in the Lake Chad Basin region.The ICC first opened a preliminary examination into Boko Haram's activities in 2010, but Amnesty has expressed concerns that progress has been slow. In its statement, the organization said that the ICC's preliminary examination has been ongoing for over a decade and that it is high time the court moved to the next stage of its investigation.Amnesty International's Senior Crisis Advisor, Joanne Mariner, said that \"a decade of violence and human suffering in the conflict with Boko Haram has been ignored by the ICC.\" She added that it is now \"time for the ICC to stop dragging its feet and to fully investigate the shocking crimes committed by all sides.\"Mariner also said that the Nigerian government has not demonstrated the ability or willingness to hold those responsible for the crimes accountable. This failure to act has only served to strengthen the call for the ICC to take a more proactive role in delivering justice to the affected communities.The Amnesty statement comes at a time when Nigeria is experiencing a resurgence in Boko Haram attacks. In June this year, the group carried out several attacks in the northeastern region, killing dozens of people, including security forces and aid workers.In response to Amnesty's call, the ICC said that it would continue to analyze information from various sources in Nigeria and that it is committed to its mission of holding perpetrators accountable. However, the court did not provide any details on the progress of its examination.Victims of Boko Haram's atrocities and their families have been waiting for years for the chance to see justice served.",

Arthur Pearson November 14, 2017 at 9:55 AMThe author, I'm sure, is correct that there has been \"a surge in white supremacist activity in the United States.\" I'm not so sure about his assumption that this surge is \"encouraged by Trump's rhetoric.\" If one were to ask the man in the street (to use an old metaphor) he would probably say that Trump's election was inspired by a surge in white supremacist activity. It doesn't take very much research to discover that this is an illusion. It is a fact that those who voted for Trump were for the most part NOT white supremacists and they were not moved to vote for Trump because he appealed to the interests of white supremacists. Trump's election can be laid to the door of those who are unable to articulate a message other than \"white supremacy.\" The election was won by those who believed in something other than white supremacy. The Democrats and their friends in the main-stream media, and in the Republican party, have chosen, as it seems, to continue on their previous path. They may succeed; at the moment it appears that they are succeeding, but the result will not be a victory for white supremacy. The result will be the end of white supremacy in this country. In the meantime, the Democrats will probably win a few local and legislative elections, but Trump will most probably be reelected in 2020.",

Temer tweeted the news of his vetoes on Monday in exchanges with supermodel Gisele Bundchen and the World Wildlife Foundation. The model had earlier tweeted Temer, imploring him to \"protect mother earth'' and kill the bills, which were passed by Congress last month. They would have converted around 1.4 million acres of protected land into areas open to logging, mining and agricultural use. But the apparent victory for environmental groups may be short-lived as Brazil's environment minister is working on similar legislation that is being harshly criticized by environmental groups. In a video posted Sunday on social media, environment minister Jose Sarney Filho announced plans to create a new bill in Congress that would downgrade the level of protection of 1.1 million acres of the Amazon rainforest. The measure is designed to legalize incursions by farmers and ranchers into protected areas in the state of Para. \"We want to allow people who have been there for a long time to continue growing and developing their work,'' he said in the video.",

Despite the rise in attacks, the number of successful hijackings has fallen. The International Maritime Bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce, reports 306 piracy incidents have been reported in the first three quarters of 2009 compared to 293 reported in all of 2008. The group attributes the jumps in total attacks from last year to Somali pirates. Attacks in the Gulf of Aden have nearly doubled, and attacks east of the Somali coast have increased nearly four-fold. The piracy appears to be increasing in armed intensity as well. The group reports the number of attacks that involved the use of firearms has doubled from 2008. International Maritime Bureau Director Pottengal Mukundan sees a silver lining in the grim statistics. \"What is very interesting is that the number of vessels, which have been successfully hijacked, [has] gone down from the figures last year,\" Mukundan said.Mukundan attributes the drop in hijackings both to the greater use of international navy patrols in the dangerous waters, as well as better prepared crews who brave the risky shipping lanes. He says captains of these ships are learning how to out-savvy the pirates in case of an attack, using evasive tactics that keep the ship moving even as the pirates open fire. Somalis claim organized piracy developed out of efforts by local fisherman to protect against illicit overfishing by outsiders taking advantage of the country's inner turmoil.",

Muslims are being targeted as payback for abuses committed by the recently ousted Seleka rebel coalition. Muslim residents in the western town of Boali have been living in a church for protection for the past month. About 500 Muslims are living at one Catholic church in Boali. Many have lost everything. They are getting little to no assistance. Ibrahim Mohamed was in Boyali, a town further northwest, when the anti-Balaka attacked on January 8. \"They had guns and grenades. We tried to fight back. All we had were bows and arrows. We called Seleka for help and fled into the bush. When Seleka got there, we came out and saw all the dead. The anti-Balaka killed my father, who was the village chief, my two wives and four of my children,\" said Mohamed.Seleka's nine-month rule has ended and throughout the west and in the capital, the anti-Balaka have been seeking revenge for those months of killing, looting and destruction. It was on January 17 that international troops pushed Seleka out of Boali. The anti-Balaka and local residents turned on the Muslims. Those that could, fled. Abbot Xavier-Arnaud Fagba went out, door to door, bringing the rest to his parish. \"I didn't have a plan.",

This is due in part to increased taxes on financial transactions announced by the Russian Central Bank, which makes trading in foreign currencies much more expensive.The carry trade, which is when investors borrow in one currency and invest in another to make a profit, has also been a major driving force behind the ruble's recent upturn. Because of the higher interest rates in Russia compared to the United States and other developed countries, investors have been taking advantage of the situation and putting their money into the ruble.The Russian economy, which has been struggling due to Western sanctions, has also been supported by the price of crude oil. While most analysts don't expect oil prices to stay high for long, the rally has added some buoyancy to the currency.Overall, the ruble has been performing well over the past few days and appears to be headed for more gains in the coming weeks.

The plan was announced by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.Conte explained that the patrol vessels will monitor the waters to disrupt and prevent smugglers from sending vessels carrying migrants across the sea. He added that the patrols will ensure the safety of those attempting to migrate while also protecting Italy's national security. The patrols will be conducted in collaboration with the Italian Coast Guard. The deployment of naval patrols is part of a broader package of measures intended to address the flow of migrants and refugees from North Africa. These measures also include an agreement with the Libyan coast guard to intercept boats carrying migrants, support for migrants in Libya, and a commitment to increase aid for African countries where many of the migrants originate.The increased focus on patrolling the Mediterranean Sea comes amid ongoing tension between Italy and France over how to deal with the influx of migrants. Macron has criticized Italy for refusing to take in boats of migrants, while Italy has argued for a more comprehensive approach to the issue. The announcement of the naval patrols marks a shift in strategy as Italy attempts to gain control over the number of migrants arriving in the country. If successful, it could provide a much-needed solution to the ongoing crisis.",

The committee chair, Rep.

Barr said he would not answer further questions about the decision, citing concerns about disclosing privileged information.However, we found the \"principles\" Barr said he was applying are part of a legal memo he sent to the Department of Justice in 2018, which some Democrats have said proves he's too biased to oversee the Mueller investigation fairly. Barr has denied the memo demonstrates bias.It turns out the \"principles\" Barr said he applied are ones that protect the president from being charged with obstruction of justice.Barr was asked by the president’s defense team at the time of his June 2018 memo to weigh in on \"whether a president could lawfully issue a 'targeted directive' to terminate an investigation into him personally, '[b]oth for the sake of the argument and in order to take the policy considerations into account.'\"He didn’t explicitly answer the question, instead offering his views on the law.\"",

Both said they had made some progress on the thorniest of the issues: Israel's insistence on allowing the expansion of Jewish settlements that are built on land claimed by the Palestinians.

The World Health Organization estimates that more than 200 million people have been diagnosed with the illness, and that most live in low- and middle-income countries. While it isn't curable, patients' lives can be extended with treatment such as steroids. A new study shows that low doses of the medicine given by mouth are equal to, or better than, a heavy dose administered intravenously. Meet Dr. Francis Welch, a retired dentist and now a patient diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. He is paying the price for years of smoking. \"I have to think about breathing 60 minutes of every hour. It's a heck of a nuisance,\" he says.Because COPD is an ailment that blocks airflow in the lungs, it is critical that COPD patients often focus on breathing, exercise regularly and learn relaxation techniques, especially when they are short of breath. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease stems from emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as asthmatic bronchitis. Other symptoms include wheezing, a chronic cough producing yellow mucous, and frequent respiratory infections.The most common cause of COPD is long-term smoking or years of exposure to second-hand smoke. Miners and workers in chemical industries also are vulnerable because of their exposure to dust, harmful chemicals and fumes. Doctors say the damage brought on by these conditions eventually interrupts the natural exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. When those conditions worsen, doctors often treat patients with steroids.Dr.",

The $5.2 billion investment promises to double the cargo capacity of the Canal by adding two new lock chambers and a new third lane of traffic, which will be capable of handling ships carrying up to 13,000 containers. The Canal’s third set of locks, scheduled to open next spring, will have a significant impact on world trade. It will also present new challenges and opportunities for ports as trade patterns change to accommodate more goods shipped through the Canal.In a new report, Making the Most of the Panama Canal Expansion, World Bank senior economist Michelle Ruta explores the project’s expected impact on the maritime sector and the implications for Panama and the rest of the world. “One of the most immediate effects of the Panama Canal expansion is the need for larger locks, taller cranes and deeper channels,” according to Ruta. “Making the appropriate investments to facilitate this traffic is the most efficient way to accommodate ships that are projected to carry up to 18,000 TEUs. Ports that are prepared to handle this traffic are likely to be the big winners.”The report also highlights new risks to ports resulting from the expanded Panama Canal. “As shipping becomes more consolidated around larger container ships, the consequences of delays at ports and other choke points in the supply chain will increase, amplifying the costs of congestion at individual ports,” Ruta explains. “The increased cost of delays will create powerful incentives to reduce congestion and improve efficiency, which will be increasingly important as the industry faces a capacity crunch on both land and sea.”As the Canal expansion nears completion, ports and port operators around the world have an opportunity to attract new business from the larger ships transiting the Canal.",

Atmospheric models suggest that it is somewhat like that of Titan.Although Pluto is much colder than Titan at the surface, Pluto's atmosphere extends 200 kilometers or more above its surface. The lower temperature means its upper atmosphere should be slightly denser than Titan's. In the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere, Pluto's atmosphere contains a large amount of ethylene, acetylene, and ethane which are formed by the breakdown of methane by solar ultraviolet radiation.Pluto's lower atmosphere also contains simple hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane, which are in vapor form. The source of these hydrocarbons is believed to be Pluto itself, a source of methane clathrate. These clathrates would have been heated by the atmosphere, releasing gaseous methane that was carried aloft.Pluto's atmosphere consists of more than 90% nitrogen, with the remaining 10% methane and carbon monoxide.",

In these countries, MPs are often targeted by extremist groups or criminal organizations because of their position.The report also found that other professions, such as journalists, doctors, and aid workers, are also at high risk of violence in some countries.However, the report notes that there are significant differences in the levels of violence and instability across different regions and countries.For example, while being an MP may be one of the most dangerous professions in Africa and Asia, it is generally considered to be a safe profession in countries such as Canada and Sweden.The report concludes that political violence and instability are major challenges for many countries around the world, and that efforts should be made to improve security for MPs and other professionals at risk of violence.In some countries, such as Somalia and Afghanistan, this may require significant reforms to the political and security systems, the report says.Overall, the report provides a valuable insight into the challenges faced by MPs and other professionals in different parts of the world, and underscores the importance of improving security and reducing violence in these countries.",

Despite efforts to help certain illegal aliens, many believe President Obama has not done enough. For most of her life in the United States, undocumented immigrant Ireri Unzueta-Carrasco has lived in the shadows. “There are a lot of obstacles when you are undocumented and you are trying to grow up. So for me it was very very frustrating,\" said Unzueta-Carrasco. Unzueta-Carrasco is no longer afraid to speak publicly about her status. She also has found new confidence to express her anger at U.S. immigration policy. Part of a movement called “No Papers, No Fear,” Unzueta-Carrasco and others held an act of civil disobedience that stopped rush-hour traffic in Knoxville, Tennessee last week (Aug. 28) on their way to the Democratic National Convention. But on this day, the target of their protest, which led to several arrests, were Tennessee law enforcement officials who are considering implementing an unpopular program known as 287G. “287G gives police officers the power to ask for your documentations once you are pulled over, so we don’t want that enforced,\" said Cruz. Undocumented immigrant Natally Cruz knows the consequences of programs like 287G. She is from Arizona, where a similar effort is already in place.",

Beavogui, who was appointed by coup leader Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, insisted that he was under no obligation to follow any pre-existing agreements made with opposition groups.The transitional government deal in question was negotiated between the ousted President Alpha Condé's government and opposition groups last year. The agreement aimed to pave the way for a unity government, which would create a more inclusive political environment and put an end to years of political unrest in Guinea.However, the recent coup on September 5th led by Colonel Doumbouya and the subsequent suspension of the constitution have left the future of Guinea's political landscape uncertain. Doumbouya has claimed that the coup was necessary to end corruption and mismanagement under Condé's rule, but concerns have been raised about the military's ability to lead the country towards a democratic future.Beavogui's comments have not been well received by opposition leaders, who fear that this could signal a lack of commitment to the transitional government deal and could potentially lead to further instability. In response, the opposition parties have demanded a clear roadmap for the country's transition, as well as guarantees for their participation in the unity government.The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the international community have been closely monitoring the situation in Guinea. In the wake of the coup, they have called for the immediate release of President Condé, the restoration of the constitution, and a swift return to civilian rule. The pressure from the international community and regional partners will likely play a significant role in Guinea's future political landscape.As Guinea grapples with its political future, the stakes are high for its citizens and the West African region as a whole. A failure to uphold the transitional government deal and ensure a smooth transition to democracy could result in further unrest and a setback for democratic progress in the region. It remains to be seen how the interim government will navigate these complex issues and find a way to achieve a stable and inclusive political environment for the people of Guinea.",

The army’s power has extended far beyond the domain of security, with the military ruling over the country for roughly half its independent history and maintaining a heavy hand even after relinquishing direct rule. Yet the upcoming elections promise change in civilian-military relations, with the former steadily becoming a stronger, more cohesive political force while the latter has seen its power steadily diminish in recent years, leading to a much more balanced, competitive political arena.What to Make of the New China-Afghanistan Plan for PeaceChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Afghan counterpart, Salahuddin Rabbani, recently laid out a plan to end the 17-year-old Afghan War. The plan consists of four key parts: a jointly brokered peace process between the Afghan government and the Taliban; a Taliban commitment to cut ties with terrorist groups; a request that the Taliban participate in the Afghan parliamentary elections, currently scheduled for October 20; and, finally, a comprehensive peace deal before Afghan presidential elections in April 2019.The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Faces New ChallengesThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), announced with much fanfare during the 2013 visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Pakistan, is a collection of infrastructure projects designed to facilitate economic and trade flows in Pakistan.

        "text": "In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump has announced plans to lift a ban on year-round sales of gasoline with high-ethanol content, a decision that is expected to benefit American farmers and the ethanol industry.Currently, the sale of gasoline containing 15% ethanol, or E15, is prohibited between June 1 and September 15 in some areas of the United States. This ban, which aims to reduce smog levels in the summer months, will be lifted under the new policy. Trump's decision will allow fuel stations to sell E15 throughout the year, which could lead to higher ethanol production and increased demand for corn, the primary feedstock for ethanol in the US.The decision comes as a response to the growing pressure from the US corn belt, particularly from the states of Iowa and Nebraska, which are the largest ethanol and corn producers in the country. The move is seen as an effort by Trump to garner support from the farming communities ahead of the midterm elections in November.The year-round sales of E15 are expected to increase ethanol consumption by up to 2 billion gallons annually, according to Geoff Cooper, the CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. This increase in ethanol demand will provide a much-needed boost to the struggling agricultural sector, which has been hit hard by Trump's ongoing trade war with China.However, Trump's decision has faced criticism from the oil industry, which has long opposed the higher ethanol blending. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has argued that the decision could result in higher gasoline prices for consumers and damage vehicle engines not designed for higher ethanol levels.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is now set to start the process of lifting the ban, which could take several months due to the required regulatory steps. This means that the year-round sales of E15 could potentially start by the summer of 2019.In conclusion, Trump's decision to lift the ban on E15 gasoline sales is a significant step for the American ethanol industry, and it has been largely welcomed by farmers in the corn belt. However, it remains to be seen how this policy shift will play out in terms of environmental concerns and the ongoing tensions between the ethanol and oil industries.",

These new images, captured by the agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions, provide unprecedented detail of the outer layers of the Sun, and are revealing many previously unseen phenomena.NASA's images, which were released on Monday, are the culmination of more than two decades of work, and have been made possible by new technology that enables scientists to map the Sun's magnetic field and its solar atmosphere, the corona. This technology is revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun, and of the effects it has on the solar system and beyond.NASA's new solar maps are already yielding valuable insight into solar dynamics and the complex web of plasma and magnetic fields that shape the Sun's dynamic and ever-changing structure. Furthermore, they provide scientists with new ways of predicting space weather and its effects on our planet, providing a better understanding of how solar activity can affect spacecraft and astronauts, and how it may influence climate change on Earth.The images also show that the Sun's atmosphere is more complex than previously thought, with the Sun's magnetic field producing unexpected behavior, including strange and complex loops, twists and magnetic knots.Solar scientists are still analyzing the images, but are already learning more about the Sun's complicated and dynamic behavior, and its effect on the solar system and beyond. The release of these images marks a major milestone in our understanding of the Sun and its effects on our planet, and is the culmination of many years of scientific research and technological innovation.",

The new round of tariffs is proposed on a list of goods the US imports from China, including computers and electronic products, food, footwear, toys, games, and sports equipment.The latest increase is a continuation of a 12-month trade conflict between the two countries that has seen both the United States and China level increasingly heavy tariffs on each other’s goods. This newest round of tariffs was originally set to be implemented in the latter half of the 2019, but has been brought forward following the breakdown of trade talks between the two countries in May.The proposed 25% tariff would be levied on imports valued at around $200 billion. If the new round of tariffs does come to fruition, almost all Chinese products imported into the United States will be subject to tariffs.A number of products are exempt from tariffs, including mobile phones, laptops, and video game consoles. Tariffs are set to be levied on a range of products including dishwashers and ovens, but not refrigerators and washing machines. China exports more dishwashers and ovens to the US than the latter two products, but the United States imports far more washing machines and refrigerators from China than dishwashers and ovens.The exclusion of some products and the inclusion of others shows that the US tariffs are targeted at specific industries and companies. While they are not directed at China alone, the tariffs are directed at Chinese companies, rather than American companies that operate in China.China has retaliated to US tariffs by increasing import taxes on a range of US goods. China is also planning to place restrictions on rare-earth exports, but is yet to formally announce them. Rare-earth metals are used in the production of electronics, from mobile phones to aircraft and military equipment.",

The attack, which occurred on Saturday, targeted a security forces' convoy outside the Pearl Continental hotel, before moving inside the hotel itself.According to officials, the attackers were four militants who arrived in a car and then opened fire on security personnel at the hotel's entrance. After a brief exchange of gunfire, the militants entered the hotel and started shooting at guests and staff members.The attack was eventually repelled by security forces, who killed all four attackers. However, at least four hotel employees and one soldier were killed in the attack, and several others were injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group that has been active in the region for years, claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement, the group said that the attack was in retaliation for the oppression of Balochistan's people by the Pakistani state.The attack comes just weeks after a suicide bombing in the city of Quetta killed 20 people, including eight members of the Hazara community. Balochistan, which is home to a number of ethnic and religious minorities, has been beset by violence and instability for years, as separatist groups and Islamist militants clash with security forces.The Pakistani government has vowed to crack down on such attacks, and has launched a number of military operations against the BLA and other groups in recent years. However, the groups have continued to carry out attacks, targeting both security forces and civilians. The attack on the hotel in Gwadar is just the latest in a long line of such incidents, and is likely to further fuel tensions in the region.",

As climate change increasingly affects the planet, efforts to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and restore forests and ecosystems have become increasingly important. Recent studies have suggested that these efforts can have a positive economic impact as well.According to one study, planting trees can generate five times more jobs than any other sector in the same amount of land. Additionally, re-growing forests could provide almost 4.5 million direct jobs worldwide, while indirect jobs in industries such as timber, paper, tourism, and conservation could total up to 60 million.Moreover, regrowing forests can help to reduce air pollution, prevent soil erosion, and improve water quality. In some cases, such efforts have led to increased agricultural yields due to better soil and water quality. Furthermore, it has been estimated that, over the next 30 years, re-growing forests could bring in up to $2.3 trillion in economic benefits. The message is clear: governments should look at re-growing forests not only as a way to fight climate change, but also as an economic opportunity that could benefit their countries in the long run.",

Tom Steyer, a billionaire and philanthropist who has invested substantial time and money campaigning in South Carolina, was in third place, with 11% of the vote.Steyer suspended his campaign following the results.Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Biden told a jubilant crowd of supporters in Columbia, S.C., Saturday night, “For all of you who have been knocked down ... and counted out, this is your campaign.“We are very much alive,” he added.President Trump weighed in on the results on Twitter.",

As tensions between the US and China over tariffs continue to escalate, authorities across the region are trying to stave off economic disaster.A range of Asian currencies have been affected by the ongoing trade worries, with countries such as South Korea, Indonesia, and Taiwan recording noticeable drops in their exchange rates. The South Korean won, for instance, dropped to its lowest level since February. Other nations in the region, such as India and Thailand, are also struggling to maintain their exchange rates in the face of increasingly difficult economic conditions.In an effort to curb the economic uncertainty, countries throughout Asia are taking steps to mitigate any potential damage. In India, for instance, the Reserve Bank of India recently issued a new directive which requires all Indian banks to maintain certain levels of their foreign exchange reserves. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has cut its benchmark rate to zero, in a bid to stimulate the economy and help increase consumer spending.The international community is watching closely to see how the situation in Asia unfolds. Governments and international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are all paying close attention to the situation, and are prepared to provide assistance to help countries facing economic difficulties.The fate of Asian economies now rests in the hands of both local and international authorities. With uncertainty still looming large, all parties are hoping that the actions they are taking will help to avert any long-term damage to the region.",

The new fiscal year, which starts on October 1, requires Congress to pass a series of spending bills to keep the government running, but disagreements between Democrats and Republicans have hindered the timely approval of the appropriations bills.This potential federal shutdown looms over the country as it continues to grapple with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of natural disasters. A shutdown would see a large number of federal services and employees furloughed, affecting millions of Americans and potentially derailing the nation's economic recovery.As a solution, lawmakers are reportedly discussing a temporary funding extension, also known as a continuing resolution (CR), which would keep the government funded at current levels for a designated period, giving Congress additional time to finalize the spending bills. This stopgap measure has been utilized in the past when the appropriations process has stalled due to political disagreements.However, a CR is not without its own issues, as it may hinder new projects, delay federal hiring, and prevent any adjustments to current funding levels in response to new challenges. Moreover, it could also lead to further fiscal uncertainty as Congress may continue to face gridlock when it comes to approving the spending bills.Despite these drawbacks, it remains a preferable option to a government shutdown, especially considering the current state of the nation. As such, key figures in both parties are expressing their willingness to cooperate and avoid a shutdown.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently stated that a short-term funding extension was a possibility, and added that he is \"working hard to avoid a shutdown.\" Similarly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has mentioned that discussions on a CR are ongoing.On the Republican side, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) indicated that he is also open to a temporary funding extension, while emphasizing the need to address the current debt ceiling crisis, another pressing issue for Congress.The push for a funding extension comes as the clock ticks down for lawmakers, with less than two weeks left before the new fiscal year begins.",

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there have already been over 850 reported tornadoes in the US in 2021, with June being the most active month so far, recording over 350 of them. The cost of this year's tornadoes is already triple the costs of 2020's season, which was considered to be unusually destructive. The most costly tornado of 2021 happened in Texas in May and caused $541 million of damage. On that same day, multiple other tornadoes were reported in several states, wreaking havoc throughout the Midwest and Southeast. Emergency management officials are warning that the season may still be far from over, especially since tornado season typically peaks around mid-summer. They are urging people to take safety precautions to protect themselves in case of a tornado, including having an emergency plan and being prepared to take shelter if needed. No matter the outcome, this tornado season is sure to be remembered for its destructive power and immense costs.",

The report, which examined the impact of Hurricane Florence in 2018, found that many residents in affected areas were unable to access emergency information or communicate with first responders due to damaged infrastructure and inadequate planning.According to the report, many emergency communication systems are still dependent on outdated technology, such as landlines and analog radio systems, which are vulnerable to disruption in times of crisis. The report also highlighted the need for better coordination between federal, state and local authorities in emergency management, as well as the need for more investment in emergency communication systems in rural areas.The report comes as the country faces increasing threats from natural disasters and other emergencies, and follows a series of high-profile emergencies in recent years, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In response to the report, government officials have pledged to work on improving emergency communication systems and addressing the challenges faced by rural areas.",

Trump has said he would let them expire, or even let them expire, and then lift them. He said a lot of U.S. sanctions have already been lifted.Bolton said the sanctions will not be lifted before elections in Russia in August and September that will determine the fate of Kremlin officials. If those elections end with Russian opposition candidates becoming the next president and the United States' patience wanes, the U.S. would consider sanctions to be in place.Bolton said that if Putin and his top lieuten are not able to form a working government in the next four months, they could face sanctions, but that the sanctions will not be lifted until the Russians have reformed their government and started working to change the country's culture and governance.\"We're ready to act,\" he said. “We're not ready to just give it up.\"Trump has been demanding an end to what he says is the long-running Russian interference in American elections.",

The individual, whose name has been withheld for his safety, is a vocal advocate for democratic reforms, transparency, and the rule of law in China. The unexpected decision has been welcomed by human rights activists and is seen as a step towards a more lenient approach to political dissent.The dissident, a former professor and political commentator, was initially sentenced to over a decade in prison for inciting subversion of state power. His writings and online presence garnered a significant following, sparking heated discussions on topics such as political reform, the influence of the Communist Party, and corruption within the country's government. Despite international condemnation, the Chinese government has maintained a strong stance against political dissent, often subjecting its critics to lengthy prison sentences and harsh punishments. Human rights organizations have continuously raised concerns regarding China's suppression of political dissent and the overall lack of freedom of expression within the country.The decision to commute the dissident's prison sentence is an unexpected change of course, with no official explanation provided by the Chinese authorities.",

Bilateral relations have soured over the two countries' support of opposing sides in the Syrian conflict. Kerem Balci, a columnist for the Turkish newspaper Zaman, says the arrests may be part of a deeper probe. \"It suggests that there should be lots of more Iranian spies working in Turkey and in fact police intelligence managed to get information from the nine people arrested that the number is about 100 Iranian spies,\" said Balci. \"It suggests there is a kind of cold war already going on between Iran and Turkey.\" What has caused alarm in Ankara is that the accused spies are suspected of gathering intelligence for the Kurdish rebel group, the PKK, which is fighting the Turkish state for greater minority rights. It would not be the first time Tehran has used the PKK to apply pressure on Ankara, according to columnist Asli Aydintasbas of the Turkish newspaper Milliyet. She says the arrests of the alleged spies is an indication of a proxy war between the neighbors over Syria. \"It has to do with Syria.
