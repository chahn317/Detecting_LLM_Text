They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart.

In more recent history, Crimea became part of the Russian Empire in 1783, and the region remained part of Russia until 1954 when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by the Soviet Government. In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea became a part of the newly independent nation of Ukraine. This history has proven to be a controversial one, as Russia continues to claim ownership over Crimea.

It saved the infrastructure. It undermined the Iraqi command-and-control. And it gave some powerful messages that we still could act without our allies, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia.

Trump “is taking in what he learned from world leaders today” to make his decision on whether to honor Washington’s commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement signed two years ago, according to the president’s chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn.Watch: Climate Change, Migration, North Korea, Terrorism Dominate Trump's 1st G-7 MeetingSorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.U.S. administration officials have said Trump, who referred to man-made global warming as a “hoax” during his successful presidential campaign last year, would wait until after the summit before making a decision on the issue. The G-7, going back more than a decade, has repeatedly recognized the threat of climate change. Closely watched will be the specific language issued about the subject in the Taormina communique, expected to be released late Friday or early Saturday. “It would be extremely rare for this major set of developed countries to not send a clear signal regarding climate change,” according to Jake Schmidt, the international program director of the National Resources Defense Council.",

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

According to the United Nations, many African nations are still heavily dependent on imports of wheat. In order to ensure food security and increase the domestic production of wheat, several initiatives have been launched.One such initiative is the 'Wheat Initiative', a global project that is seeking to increase wheat production in Africa and other developing countries. The project is expected to improve the quality of wheat varieties, increase access to high quality and improved seed, and encourage the use of improved management practices, among other things.Another project which is making strides in increasing wheat production in Africa is the Global Yield Gap and Water Productivity Atlas (GYGA). The project aims to create an index of wheat yields for Africa, which will help countries target investments and resources to improve wheat productivity.These projects are only a few of many other initiatives that are seeking to boost Africa's wheat production and ensure sustainable food security for the continent.",

What to do with a pair of dilapidated buildings on the edge of his property?Today Dinwiddie, who moved to this bucolic slice of far western France known as the Finistere more than a decade ago, has found the solution. Solar panels glisten from atop a now elegant stone veranda — Dinwiddie’s contribution to a larger energy transition.“We don’t use the electricity as such,” he said ruefully. “We sell it back into the energy grid, and buy it back at half the price from EDF… which is a bit crazy, really.”EDF, or Electricite de France, is France’s national power company, which operates the country’s 58 nuclear power plants, although it also has a renewable energy wing. But to install his solar panels, Dinwiddie turned to Quenea, one of dozens of local companies now mushrooming around the area.As negotiators from 195 nations try to reach a climate deal in Paris, regional and local governments aren’t waiting. Many are forging ahead with their own climate action plans that are sometimes more ambitious than national ones.“If you look at the delivery and implementation of what comes out of Paris, most will take place at the state, regional or city level,” said Libby Ferguson, state and regions director for UK nonprofit The Climate Group.

He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute.

The Santiago archbishopric said in a statement that Ricardo Ezzati had been summoned to speak with prosecutors on August 21 as a defendant accused of concealment. Prosecutors investigating criminal accusations against bishops, clerics and lay workers in the Roman Catholic Church in Chile are also probing claims that Ezzati and others covered up a network of 14 priests who systematically abused minors. Ezzati denied wrongdoing and vowed to cooperate with authorities. \"I reiterate my commitment and the commitment of Santiago's Church to the victims,\" Ezzati said in the statement by his office. \"I have the conviction that I never covered up or obstructed justice, and as a citizen will fulfill my duty to contribute all the information that may help clarify the facts.\" Last month police seized documents from the ecclesiastical court of the diocese of Santiago. The child sex abuse crisis has gripped Chile's Catholic Church since 2011, when Chilean priest Fernando Karadima was found guilty by the Vatican of abusing children in the 1970s and 1980s. Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima's victims, said on Twitter that Ezzati has \"little time left as archbishop of Santiago, but his new mission of answering for his cover-up, lies and other crimes ... has just begun.\"",

The international community has applauded Muse's election and has offered financial support in order to encourage stability in Somalia. However, Islamist factions fear that his election was a deliberate attempt to undermine them, and have issued statements of protest since his election.Tensions in Somalia have heightened in recent months as Islamist groups battle with the Transitional Federal Government, and the recent election of Muse is likely to add fuel to the fire. It remains to be seen whether the international community's support for Muse will be enough to stem the rising tide of Islamist violence, or whether the election will have the opposite effect and spark a resurgence of the Islamist movement.",

Eritrea is the famous case of the G-11, the members of parliament who wrote a critical letter to the authorities, to the president, Afwerki, 2001, and were taken away in September that year and were never seen again. And, then the case in Zambia where there are concerns about the use of the Public Order Act and the limitations that that brings along for the right to freedom of assembly,” said Huizenga.In Asia, the IPU cites 78 MPs from 12 countries who are under threat.It singles out the Maldives as the worst violator.",

This week, the Myanmar military announced that it was undertaking a fresh offensive that includes airstrikes, artillery bombardments and ground assaults against Kachin rebels.The renewed military offensive in Kachin came just weeks after the Myanmar government announced a unilateral ceasefire, to end all armed conflict in the country. The renewed fighting marks a setback to the government’s efforts to bring peace to the conflict-ridden northern state, which is home to many ethnic minorities. The Myanmar military has been accused of numerous human rights abuses in its operations against the rebels in Kachin, including extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and forced labor.

As hundreds more remain camped out in Taiwan’s parliament, the government weighs what to do next. About 2,000 police officers expelled hundreds of protesters from Taiwan’s guarded cabinet offices before dawn on Monday. The government mobilized riot squads and water cannons to oust demonstrators in a five-hour struggle. Protesters want to stop quick approval of the trade deal, calling that approach risky as China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and wants political reunification. Lin Nan-hsin, a 20-year-old protester from a university in central Taiwan, was among those expelled by police. He said there are two camps of protesters, one that advocates peace and the other that prefers a more extreme form of protest as the only way of getting the government’s attention. Lin said that in the end, there was a discussion with the lead protest planners about whether to break into the cabinet complex and finally a go-ahead was given. Taiwan and China signed a service trade pact in June following several other trade and investment agreements reached since 2008.",

Trump brought 52 business leaders from New York City to the White House Tuesday to talk about another favorite campaign issue — infrastructure and economic growth. The U.S. economy has so far proven to be a point of pride for a presidency that has otherwise gotten off to a rocky start. Trump inherited a stable economy from former President Barack Obama, an economic recovery that's heading toward its eighth year. But Trump believes he can do more for business. Trump and several of his top aides emphasized plans to cut red tape and jumpstart infrastructure projects at Tuesday's meeting, while also previewing for the CEOs other priorities that include shortening flight times for airplanes, increasing the power grid's efficiency and targeting programs to improve job training. At one point the president had an aide come on stage to hold up a long scroll of the government's approval process for building a highway. The president then pledged to eliminate more than 90 percent of the regulations involved and \"still have safety.'' He provided no details. The administration has committed to directing as much as $1 trillion for infrastructure over the next decade, although it has yet to release policy specifics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently said she expects a plan will be unveiled later this year.

The Constitutional Court upheld the election results.Nikol Pashinyan, an opposition activist at the time who was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests, was elected prime minister by parliament on May 8 this year.Kocharyan said the latest charges were politically motivated, but added he was ready to spend time in prison.\"These charges are fiction, fabricated, unjustified and have a political implication,\" he told an independent Armenian Yerkir Media TV.Kocharyan also said the most likely development was his arrest, but he did not intend to run away.\"",

Russian police raided the apartments of top opposition leaders in Moscow on Monday, the day before a mass rally is to take place against President Putin. Armed with assault rifles, investigative police raided 10 homes and offices. They said they were looking for evidence surrounding the last big anti-Putin rally. Staged the day before Putin's May 7 presidential inauguration, that rally ended in violence with 20 policemen injured and 436 protesters detained. Democratic Russia Committee Director Natalia Pelevine says the raids were designed to intimidate opposition leaders and their supporters. \"They are trying to confiscate electronic equipment, probably computers and DVDs and any device that can hold information pretty much. We know they are confiscating that at this moment,\" Pelevine said. In the raids, police beat down the doors of two of the best known leaders of the younger generation of democracy protesters, internet blogger Alexei Navalny and television hostess Ksenia Sobchak. Later, a police source told Interfax that police confiscated nearly $1,900,000 from Sobchak's apartment.

The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight.

The U.S. and several other countries have imposed sanctions on Iran in an attempt to curtail its nuclear ambitions, but critics argue these measures do not go far enough and more needs to be done to stop Iran before it's too late.",

The past several months have been spent far from the classroom for many, as they were forced to remain in quarantine due to their proximity to the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools re-open, officials are working to ensure that students are given the help they need to return seamlessly, with educational and social supports in place to help with the transition. The federal government is providing grants to states to help cover the costs of extra personnel and supplies needed during this period.

It says the growing number of displaced is straining the ability of aid agencies to shelter and care for those forced to flee their homes. The U.N. refugee agency says thousands of civilians in north Yemen are fleeing to neighboring provinces in a desperate search for safety, shelter and assistance. It says it is fast running out of space and money to care for them. The current wave of fighting between the government and al-Houthi rebels is entering the sixth month and by all accounts is intensifying. U.N. refugee spokesman Andrej Mahecic says battles keep shifting from one place to another, forcing many people to be displaced a number of times. \"These newly displaced people bring stories of intense clashes in Razeh, Saqain and Sahar districts and report dozens of civilian casualties as a result of air strikes and heavy fighting,\" he said. \"UNHCR is not present in the conflict area and has no independent confirmation of these reports. We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been affected by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year,\" he added.",

According to the study, the origins of the language can be traced back to a nomadic tribe living in the Turkish steppes between the 4th and 6th centuries CE. From there, it spread across Europe and then the world. The researchers have stated that, based on their findings, the English language may be the oldest language in the world, with its roots reaching back thousands of years. They have also suggested that the language has evolved so much over the years that its modern form is almost unrecognisable from the language as it was originally spoken in Turkey.",

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo followed up talks with Dimitrov by expressing strong support for the deal, signed this summer, in which Macedonia agreed to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. Greece and Macedonia have been feuding over who gets to use the name since Macedonia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Many Greeks say allowing the neighboring country to use the name insults Greek history and implies a claim on the Greek territory also known as Macedonia, a key province in Alexander the Great's ancient empire. As a result, Greece has blocked Macedonian efforts to join the EU and NATO. Despite recognition by 137 countries, Macedonia is officially known at the United Nations as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). \"It's a great day for Macedonian diplomacy,\" Dimitrov said of his meeting with Pompeo, which he described as \"very encouraging.\"\"We are now focused on our homework — we need to win a referendum to get our people to stand behind the name agreement that we have reached with our friends in Greece that unlocks the doors for the future,\" he said. \"And here the support and friendship of our American partners is extremely important. So, I go back to Macedonia greatly encouraged.\"",

Sharif is in London, along with his children, caring for his wife who is undergoing treatment for cancer.Sharif has denounced the verdict as politically motivated and accused a covert military-judiciary alliance of trying to keep him out of politics and undermining the integrity of his PML-N party to enable alliance favorites to win Pakistan’s upcoming national elections on July 25.",
