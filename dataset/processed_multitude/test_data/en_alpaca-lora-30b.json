The deal is worth $3 billion and includes the sale of 15 Boeing 737 MAXs and 15 Boeing 777s. The agreement follows a landmark nuclear deal that has eased economic sanctions against Iran. Iran Air is the second largest airline in the Middle East and its new acquisitions are a sign of its ambitious expansion plans. The deal is a huge win for Boeing, who has not sold planes to Iran for years due to US sanctions. Iran Air expects the new fleet to arrive in the next two years and will allow the airline to carry out more flights to long-haul destinations.",

Meanwhile, Native American women are also subjected to an arrest rate that is 4.4 times higher than the arrest rate of white women, with Native American women being the most likely group to experience police brutality.The results of the study suggest that despite reforms, native women continue to face unfair treatment and criminalization.

Both nations want to avoid a potential military confrontation with the Philippines that would undermine their interests.Duterte has taken a hardline approach to tackling the issue since his inauguration in June, pledging to take “drastic measures” if Beijing does not agree to bilateral talks on the disputed islands in the South China Sea.China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its own, and has been ramping up its military presence there for several years. The Philippines and Vietnam, as well as a host of other nations, lay claim to parts of the sea. The US has been increasingly vocal about its interests in the region and last month conducted joint military patrols with the Philippines in the disputed waters.If Duterte is not willing to back down from his position, Beijing and Washington could find themselves in direct confrontation over the issue. The US has made it clear it will not stand for any unilateral actions by China in the South China Sea, while Beijing has made it clear that it will defend its interests in the region.While the US and China have both been pushing for dialogue with the Philippines, Duterte has so far made no promises on bilateral talks.

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be? I am certain it will be John's.''Said House Speaker Paul Ryan, ``His legacy is so long that John McCain is a hero to us all.''",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",
