The building is in an ethnically diverse, densely populated West London’s North Kensington area. Among those missing on Wednesday were a number of children.Witnesses said they heard screams for help as the fire stormed through the floors, trapping residents who could be seen from windows flashing their cell phone lights in hopes of being rescued. Witnesses said some residents held small children from windows while other people jumped from the lower stories of the building.?Watch video from the scene:Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Why did fire spread so quickly?",

Kim Hyun-hee - once sentenced to death for blowing up an airliner - says she may have information about the Japanese woman's fate.Former North Korean spy Kim Hyun-hee wiped tears from her eyes, Wednesday, as she spoke to the brother and son of a Japanese woman who disappeared decades ago.Kim told the relatives not to give up hope and that they will see the woman again. Kim Hyun-hee has not appeared in such a high-profile way since 1991 - when she spoke to the South Korean public about an act of terrorism she was convicted of committing, four years earlier. Kim says she placed a bomb on a Korean Airlines flight that exploded in midair, killing all 115 people on board. For that crime, she was sentenced to die, then given a South Korean presidential pardon.To fulfill her mission, Kim posed with another North Korean agent as a married Japanese couple. She says was able to speak and act as a Japanese person because she was taught for two years by Yaeko Taguchi - the woman whose family says she was abducted to North Korea in 1978.Wednesday's emotional meeting between Kim and two of Taguchi's male family members took place in Busan.",

According to health officials, the indigenous people of Australia are at a higher risk of contracting the virus due to their poor living conditions and lack of access to basic healthcare.Aborigines are often forced to live in remote areas, without running water or proper sanitation, making it easier for the virus to spread. In addition, many indigenous Australians suffer from chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and respiratory diseases, which can weaken their immune system and make them more vulnerable to the virus.The situation is particularly concerning for pregnant women and children, who are at a higher risk of developing severe complications from the flu. Health workers are struggling to reach remote communities and provide adequate care, making it difficult to contain the spread of the virus.The Australian government has declared a national emergency and is taking measures to contain the outbreak.

It says the new view will greatly help scientists understand solar storms that can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth. VOA's David McAlary reports.The new 3-D images came from twin NASA spacecraft named STEREO, launched last October. They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart. The separation provides a three dimensional view of the sun, just as the offset in our eyes gives us depth perception.Until the advent of this identical pair of observatories, images from Earth telescopes or orbiting solar telescopes were two dimensional. NASA solar scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta says the three dimensional images will help scientists determine where matter and energy flow in the sun's atmosphere much more precisely.\"We have to move away from the traditional sun-Earth line to view the sun from around, from over the poles, from under the poles to really get a deeper understanding of what is inside the sun, what is coming out of its surface, how is it affecting the entire solar system that we live in,\" said Madhulika Guhathakurta.The main STEREO project scientist, Michael Kaiser, says the satellites' depth perception will help improve space weather forecasts.Of particular concern are powerful eruptions of billions of tons of electrically charged gas that smash into Earth's magnetic field at millions of kilometers per hour.",

The \"shock and awe\" campaign started on March 20th with allied air strikes against leadership targets as US and British forces rolled across the border from Kuwait.On April 5th, American heavy armor penetrated Baghdad. And today, what fighting remains is largely mopping-up pockets of resistance as the U-S leads the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.How was the war won so quickly? And what are the lessons to be learned?Joining me to examine the Iraq war are: military strategist, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters; and military historian Victor Davis Hanson of California State University in Fresno, Califronia.Victor Hanson, let me begin with you. In your view, what was the key factor in the coalition victory in Iraq?MR. HANSON: I think it was the ability to start the ground war almost simultaneously with the air war that gave some tactical surprise, when it was hard to achieve surprise because of the past record in Afghanistan and Kosovo, where we didn't use sizeable numbers of ground troops. It saved the infrastructure. It undermined the Iraqi command-and-control. And it gave some powerful messages that we still could act without our allies, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia. We sort of envisioned the Iraqis -- the Baathists -- as a snake of sorts that was coiled around the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, and rather than just hacking at the coils, we went straight to Baghdad and tried to decapitate it.MR. MORALES: Ralph Peters, let me put that same question to you.MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with everything that has just been said as far as the operational factors go, but I think there is something even beyond that. This really was a civilizational victory.",

We are passing through it together. We have some differences, differences in our outlook. We are very sincerely trying to help out [in] the reconciliation.

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",

Trump made the proposal on Twitter, saying that it would be \"a great place for them to go.\"Trump's plan has faced immediate backlash from Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups, who argue that it is unconstitutional and violates the human rights of immigrants. Many sanctuary cities have also vowed to resist any attempt to force them to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.The proposal is the latest development in the ongoing battle between Trump and Democrats over immigration policy. The President has made cracking down on illegal immigration a signature issue of his presidency, and has repeatedly called for stricter enforcement measures, including the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border.Democrats, on the other hand, have criticized Trump's policies as divisive and ineffective, and have pushed for a more compassionate approach to immigration. They have also sought to limit the President's authority on immigration, introducing legislation that would block him from building the wall without congressional approval.The debate over illegal immigration is likely to continue, as the issue remains a contentious one in US politics.",

But smaller and diplomatically isolated Taiwan also claims the disputed Senkaku archipelago, which it calls the Diaoyutai. In Taipei, authorities have shied away from confrontation, while seeking to play a larger role in resolving the conflict. On Tuesday, Taiwanese officials urged Japan and China to back down from a conflict about the Senkaku islets, some 220 kilometers from Taiwan.Taiwan wants Japan to resume talks, after 16 earlier rounds, on fishing rights in waters near the uninhabited islets. Taiwan also asked the other claimants to consider Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s proposal for setting aside their territorial disputes to explore jointly for resources. Foreign Minister Timothy Yang told a news conference in Taipei that he is worried that the conflict will spiral. He says it is easy to escalate a conflict and harder to make peace. But Yang calls Taiwan a peacemaker for the international community and says that, in face of the East China Sea developments, the president has formulated a peace initiative. He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute. When President Ma took office in 2008, he said that despite diplomatic isolation Taiwan would try for more informal participation in international affairs.",

The strategy, which involves increased diplomatic and economic engagement with Afghanistan and its neighbors, was intended to bring stability to the region and promote economic growth. However, the increase in violence and the ongoing Taliban insurgency have many experts questioning whether the strategy is working.Despite the challenges, there are some who believe that the South Asia strategy is showing promise. For example, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has praised the strategy, saying that it has helped bring peace to the region. Ghani also highlighted the significant increase in economic aid to the region, which he believes will help to boost economic growth.Critics of the strategy, however, point to the ongoing violence in Afghanistan as evidence that it is not working. They argue that increased diplomatic and economic engagement with the Taliban will only serve to embolden the insurgent group and prolong the conflict. Additionally, the continued presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan is seen as a hindrance to progress, and many believe that a timeline for their withdrawal is necessary for stability in the region.As the situation in Afghanistan remains fragile, it is clear that the South Asia strategy is a complex and multifaceted approach that has both positive and negative effects. While it may be too early to determine the ultimate success of the strategy, it is clear that continued engagement and diplomacy will be necessary to bring stability to the region.",

The prospect of hordes of visitors has raised concerns that the country's unique identity and environmental balance could be at risk.Bhutan has until recently restricted tourism to a few hundred visitors per year, in order to protect its culture and environment. However, the government has now announced plans to increase the number of tourists to 10,000 per year, in a bid to boost the country's economy.The move has sparked a heated debate, with many people warning that the increased tourism could lead to the degradation of Bhutan's environment, as well as the erosion of the country's unique cultural traditions.\"Bhutan is a delicate ecological and cultural system that is very vulnerable to external pressures,\" said Sonam Tobgay, a Bhutanese environmentalist. \"If we are not careful, we could lose everything that makes Bhutan special.\"There are also concerns that the influx of tourists could lead to overcrowding and damage to the country's infrastructure, as well as rising prices and a decline in the standard of living for local people.Despite these fears, many Bhutanese people welcome the prospect of increased tourism, seeing it as an opportunity to boost the country's economy and improve people's livelihoods.The Bhutanese government is keen to stress that it will take measures to ensure that tourism development is sustainable and responsible, and that it will not compromise the country's unique identity and cultural heritage.\"We understand the concerns of those who are worried about the impact of tourism on Bhutan,\" said Dasho Karma Ura, the country's tourism secretary.",

The rural vote appears as divided as it is elsewhere.As Egyptians await the results of their first truly open presidential election, fault lines between Islamists and old guard secularists appear to cut across the nation. In the village of Kafr Kandil, south of Cairo, the choice plays well with the largely conservative rural vote: some seek stability in religion, others in past performance. Many of the latter look to veteran diplomat Amr Moussa, who along with former Air Force chief Ahmed Shafik, promises a return to pre-uprising law and order, minus the corruption. Outside the village school, which is serving as the village polling station, Shadia Ewis, a housewife and mother of five, hopes Moussa wins. She thinks he's a \"respectable man\" who \"could control the country.\" Her friend and fellow housewife, Magda Hassan, agrees. She says she wants Moussa to institute reforms, so that it won't be like it was under the old government, when everything was exploited. Getting a fair shake from the government is a key concern of Islamist candidates' supporters, too. Farmer Ali Hassan Abdel Baki believes the best man for the job is the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi.

Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Congolese-born former United Nations envoy and playwright Harold Grinspoon have launched an initiative aimed at increasing awareness and education about sexual violence and HIV/AIDS in the country.The initiative, called \"Silence = Death\", takes its name from the famous slogan used by the AIDS activist group, ACT UP, in the 1980s. It aims to raise awareness about the issue of sexual violence in the DRC and to provide education on prevention, particularly in regards to the spread of HIV/AIDS.Guehenno, a former senior UN official, served as the United Nations' Deputy Special Representative for the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2009 to 2013. He also worked as the Director of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the United Nations from 2005 to 2009.

The selection process for the World Bank's top job typically involves a transparent and merit-based approach, but many have questioned whether this was followed in Malpass's case.The controversy has overshadowed the World Bank's efforts to support developing countries, and has raised concerns about the organization's ability to continue its mission. The World Bank plays a critical role in providing financing and technical assistance to low- and middle-income countries, and its success is crucial for reducing poverty and promoting economic growth.It is essential that the World Bank's next president is able to restore faith in the organization and its mission. The selection process must be transparent and merit-based, and the president must be committed to reducing poverty and promoting economic growth for all countries, not just one.The World Bank has long been a leader in the global fight against poverty and inequality. It is imperative that the organization continues to live up to this legacy and remains focused on its core mission, despite any controversies that may arise. The world is counting on it.",

        "text": "Facebook is investing heavily in developing robots and artificial intelligence, leading many to wonder: why is Facebook so keen on robots? The answer is simple: robots and AI are the future of technology and Facebook wants to be at the forefront of this revolution.Over the past few years, Facebook has acquired several robotics companies, including Oculus, which makes virtual reality headsets. This has led many to speculate that Facebook is interested in developing robots for virtual reality and other applications.But Facebook's interest in robots goes beyond just virtual reality. The company also wants to use robots to help improve its other products, such as its AI assistant, M.Facebook believes that robots and AI will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, from helping people with disabilities to improving customer service. With its investment in robots and AI, Facebook is seeking to create new products and services that can benefit people around the world.The development of robots and AI is not just limited to Facebook. Many other companies, including Google and Amazon, are also investing heavily in these technologies. However, Facebook's focus on robots and AI sets it apart from its competitors and positions it at the forefront of this new revolution in technology.In conclusion, Facebook's investment in robots and AI shows that the company is committed to staying ahead of the curve when it comes to technology. As the world becomes more reliant on robots and AI, it is clear that Facebook is positioning itself to be a major player in this field.",

Several countries have made strides towards democratization, with many implementing reforms to improve governance and transparency. This has been particularly evident in North Africa, where countries such as Egypt and Tunisia have made important strides towards democratic reform.While there are still many challenges facing the region, the progress made in recent years is cause for optimism.

Our correspondent reports the attempt renews tensions between protesters and law enforcement.?This is god**** our park! This is our park! The real people?s park! It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

However, more needs to be done to overcome the epidemic, which continues to disproportionately affect marginalized communities such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who use drugs.In a report released yesterday, UNAIDS highlights the need for continued investment in HIV prevention and treatment programs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where the majority of new HIV infections occur. The report notes that efforts to scale up HIV testing and treatment have been hampered by a lack of funding and inadequate access to services.Despite the progress made in recent years, there are still major challenges that must be overcome. Stigma and discrimination continue to fuel the epidemic, and many people are still unaware of their HIV status. In addition, many countries have yet to adopt policies that support key population groups, such as sex workers, who are at high risk of HIV infection.In order to sustain the momentum against AIDS, UNAIDS has called for increased political leadership and stronger commitment from governments, civil society, and the private sector. It also emphasizes the need for greater investment in research and development of new HIV prevention and treatment technologies.The UNAIDS report highlights the need for continued action to end the AIDS epidemic, which has already claimed too many lives and continues to disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities.",

These actions, the analyst noted, are in violation of U.S. laws that prohibit providing support to terrorist groups.The forthcoming indictments could have significant implications for the Somali community in the United States, as many members are already facing challenges in integrating into American society.

The unemployment rate has also fallen to a 30-year low, indicating a robust job market.The news has been welcomed by the Bush administration, which has been pushing for policies to boost economic growth. \"This is further evidence that our policies are working to create jobs and growth in the US economy,\" said Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill.However, some economists have expressed concern that the strong growth could lead to inflation and an overheating economy, and have called for the Federal Reserve to take steps to curb inflation.The Federal Reserve, which has been monitoring the situation closely, has indicated that it is prepared to take action if necessary to keep inflation under control. \"We will continue to monitor the economy closely and take steps as needed to ensure price stability,\" said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.The news has been welcomed by the public as well, with many expressing confidence in the economy and in the policies of the Bush administration. \"I think things are looking up,\" said John Smith, a small business owner in New York. \"I'm optimistic about the future of the economy.\"The strong economic growth has also been felt in the job market, with many companies reporting increased profits and hiring more workers.",

In May, thousands of people marched through the streets of Buenos Aires to mark the 10th anniversary of the attack.The bombing has been a sensitive issue in Argentina, where Jewish communities have long complained of discrimination and anti-Semitism.

It was supported by a wide range of civil society organizations, including human rights groups and labor unions.The marchers called for justice not only for the victims of the 1994 bombing, but for all victims of terrorism.

The President claimed that the economy is the best it has ever been. While the economy has been strong in recent years, it is not the best it has ever been. In fact, there have been several periods in American history when the economy has performed better, such as in the 1960s.2. Trump also claimed that his administration has created 7 million jobs. While it is true that the economy has added jobs during Trump's presidency, the President's number is an exaggeration. The actual number of jobs created is closer to 2 million.3. The President also claimed that he has cut regulations more than any other President in history. While it is true that the Trump Administration has rolled back many regulations, this claim is not supported by data. In fact, the Obama Administration was the most active in terms of creating regulations, while the Trump Administration has actually increased the number of regulations.4. Trump also claimed that his administration has achieved the \"greatest progress in the history of our country\" in terms of addressing the opioid crisis. While it is true that the Administration has taken some steps to address the crisis, this claim is misleading. In reality, the opioid crisis continues to be a major problem in the United States and has not been effectively addressed.5. Finally, the President claimed that his Administration has \"started the construction of a wall on the southern border\". While it is true that some construction of the wall has taken place, the claim that it has been \"started\" is misleading. The wall remains incomplete and many parts of it have yet to be built.In conclusion, while the President made some accurate statements in his State of the Union address, he also made several exaggerated or misleading claims. As journalists, it is important to fact-check the statements made by public figures and hold them accountable for their accuracy.",

The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight. Poland is currently governed by the conservative Law and Justice party led by Kaczynski's twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is intent on finding and punishing those guilty of his brother's death.",

The case was later dropped by prosecutors due to a lack of evidence, and Strauss-Kahn returned to France where he faced further legal challenges.Critics of the former banker argue that the dismissal of charges is just a part of a larger pattern of elite impunity, pointing to his previous involvement in a prostitution scandal as well as accusations of sexual misconduct in France. They fear that his dismissal of the charges will embolden him to continue his alleged misconduct, and that he will not face any consequences for his actions.Supporters of Strauss-Kahn, on the other hand, see the decision as a vindication of his innocence, and a testament to his reputation as a skilled economist and leader. They argue that the charges were politically motivated and that the trial was a waste of time and resources.The case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a stark reminder of the complexities of the legal system, and the difficulties of achieving justice in high-profile cases. While some see the dismissal of charges as a miscarriage of justice, others see it as a validation of the former banker's innocence.",

Some believe that Barr is simply following the law, while others suggest that he is acting as an advocate for the President. The recent release of the Mueller report has done little to clarify the situation. On the one hand, Barr's decision to release a summary of the report, rather than the full document, has been criticized as an attempt to shape the narrative in the President's favor. On the other hand, Barr has argued that he was simply trying to protect grand jury material from being disclosed. Whatever the truth may be, it is clear that Barr's actions have been controversial and have only added to the ongoing debate about the relationship between the President and the Justice Department.\"Please confirm if this is the correct response.",

She has made several visits to Panzi Hospital in the DRC's South Kivu Province, where many rape victims are brought. From Toronto, Canada, she spoke to VOA English to Africa Service reporter Joe De Capua about her impressions when she paid her first visit to the hospital.\"Because of V-day?I've spent the last 10 years traveling to probably 60 and I've spent a lot of time in what I call the rape mines of the world. You know, in Bosnia, in Afghanistan and Haiti and Kosovo. But I have to tell you nothing quite prepared me for the level of violence and atrocities that I heard and witnessed in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" she says.She says that the war has been allowed to continue with impunity, describing the government as non-functional and UN peacekeepers as ineffective. \"Because it's gone on for so long, it's become ordinary. It's become something that's now a part of everyday life. As an activist said there, rape has become a country sport,\" she says.Ensler says estimates put the number of women raped in the eastern DRC in the last 10 years at up to 400,000. \"But the kind of violence that's going on ? the gang rapings, the militias that are released knowing that they have AIDS and released on communities knowing they have STDs?",

Sharif is in London, along with his children, caring for his wife who is undergoing treatment for cancer.Sharif has denounced the verdict as politically motivated and accused a covert military-judiciary alliance of trying to keep him out of politics and undermining the integrity of his PML-N party to enable alliance favorites to win Pakistan’s upcoming national elections on July 25.",

However, he has since paid the owed amount, plus interest.Overall, the Senate panel's endorsement of Geithner's nomination is seen as a significant step towards the confirmation of Obama's Treasury Secretary pick.",
