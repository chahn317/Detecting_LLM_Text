He added that the party would not be bound by any specific ideology and would instead prioritize competence, efficiency, and innovation.Chahed served as Prime Minister of Tunisia from 2016 to 2020 and was a member of the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party before resigning and forming his own political entity. He faced criticism during his time in office for his handling of the economy and his response to social unrest, but he maintained strong support from some quarters.The announcement of Tayar Al-Machrek comes at a time of heightened political tension in Tunisia, with the country facing economic and social challenges and a divided political landscape.",

The collection, which included personal items such as glasses, a watch, and a wallet, had been expected to fetch around $2 million. The items were sold to an anonymous buyer by Christie's auction house in New York, with the proceeds going to fund a charitable foundation set up by Gandhi's family.The sale of the items had been closely watched by the Indian government, which had expressed concerns that the items could fall into the wrong hands and be used to foment unrest. Gandhi, who is revered in India as a symbol of nonviolent resistance, was assassinated in 1948. His belongings had been kept by his family members and were put up for auction for the first time.The auction was a significant moment for India, which had long claimed ownership of the items and had attempted to block their sale. However, a US court had ruled that the items were not stolen property, but rather the legitimate property of Gandhi's family, and could be sold.The sale of the items is expected to be a major boost for the charitable foundation set up by Gandhi's family, which supports a range of causes, including education and healthcare. The family has expressed its gratitude for the successful sale, and has pledged to continue its work in promoting the values of nonviolence and peace that Gandhi espoused.",

        "text": "Washington, DC - The US government has urged food processors to reduce the amount of salt in their products by one-third. The move is aimed at reducing the nation's salt intake, which is linked to a number of health problems, including high blood pressure and heart disease.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a target of reducing the average amount of salt consumed per day from 3,400 milligrams to 2,600 milligrams by 2025. The agency believes that this reduction is achievable and will have a significant impact on public health.According to the FDA, excessive salt consumption is a major contributor to the high rates of hypertension in the US. The agency estimates that reducing salt intake by 30% could prevent millions of cases of hypertension and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs.In response to the government's call to action, many food manufacturers have already begun reducing the amount of salt in their products. Some have developed low-sodium versions of popular foods, while others have reformulated their products to use alternative seasonings and flavorings.However, the FDA acknowledges that some foods are naturally high in salt and may require special processing or ingredient substitutions to reduce salt content. The agency is working with industry stakeholders to develop voluntary sodium reduction targets for these products.Despite the challenges, public health experts are hailing the government's initiative as a major step towards improving public health. The American Heart Association has praised the FDA for taking \"bold action\" to address the nation's salt consumption, and has called on other countries to follow the US's lead.In conclusion, the US government's call to action is a significant step towards reducing the country's salt intake and improving public health.",

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be? I am certain it will be John's.''Said House Speaker Paul Ryan, ``His legacy is so long that John McCain is a hero to us all.''",

        "text": "NEW DELHI - The U.S. Ambassador to India has met Indian opposition leader Narendra Modi, ending a near decade-long boycott of the man who is the frontrunner to be India’s next prime minister. The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",
