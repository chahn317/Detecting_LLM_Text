Among those missing on Wednesday were a number of children.Witnesses said they heard screams for help as the fire stormed through the floors, trapping residents who could be seen from windows flashing their cell phone lights in hopes of being rescued. Witnesses said some residents held small children from windows while other people jumped from the lower stories of the building.?Watch video from the scene:Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Why did fire spread so quickly?",

Kim Hyun-hee - once sentenced to death for blowing up an airliner - says she may have information about the Japanese woman's fate.Former North Korean spy Kim Hyun-hee wiped tears from her eyes, Wednesday, as she spoke to the brother and son of a Japanese woman who disappeared decades ago.Kim told the relatives not to give up hope and that they will see the woman again. Kim Hyun-hee has not appeared in such a high-profile way since 1991 - when she spoke to the South Korean public about an act of terrorism she was convicted of committing, four years earlier. Kim says she placed a bomb on a Korean Airlines flight that exploded in midair, killing all 115 people on board. For that crime, she was sentenced to die, then given a South Korean presidential pardon.To fulfill her mission, Kim posed with another North Korean agent as a married Japanese couple. She says was able to speak and act as a Japanese person because she was taught for two years by Yaeko Taguchi - the woman whose family says she was abducted to North Korea in 1978.Wednesday's emotional meeting between Kim and two of Taguchi's male family members took place in Busan.",

The call for Kim’s departure comes amid multiple reports of mismanagement and misconduct during his seven-year tenure as head of the development lender. According to reports, Kim has repeatedly used World Bank resources to support politically motivated projects, rather than strictly aid-oriented programs.Several European nations are leading the effort to remove Kim from the World Bank, citing his inability to respond to the global financial crisis and unwillingness to promote economic growth in the Middle East and Africa. The World Bank's Board of Directors is said to be discussing a plan to appoint a new President as soon as possible. “We want to ensure that the organization has a leader who can bring fresh ideas and transformational change,” said one Board Member, who preferred to remain anonymous. Meanwhile, Kim has rejected the mounting criticism. “My commitment to serve the people of the world is stronger than ever,” he said in a statement. “I am confident that the work I have done with the World Bank will be seen as a meaningful contribution.”Although Kim has survived previous attempts to remove him, recent events suggest that he may be losing the support of some of his former allies.

These traditional producers believe that over the years, moon cakes have become too commercialized and too focused on luxurious packaging.According to one producer, the Hong Kong government has imposed new restrictions on packaging materials and this may be a contributing factor to the push for more traditional packaging. The producers are also concerned that expensive packaging will increase the cost of moon cakes, which could be a burden to their customers.These producers hope that their decision will help preserve the traditional value of the festival and its beloved treats.

The bay is infamous for its floating rubbish and hazardous oil slicks.Rio state's environmental agency Inea said the plan will include the use of chemical floatation agents to remove rubbish, the dredging of sediment and construction of a wastewater treatment facility.The mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, acknowledged that the clean-up will not be a complete solution, and that it would require more than one billion reals to fix the problem completely. However, the mayor expressed optimism that hosting the Olympic sailing events will bring increased attention to the plight of Guanabara Bay and motivate authorities to better protect the environment.The government of Rio has already taken steps to discourage polluting industries from operating near the bay, and has established several conservation zones in the region.

The result had been widely expected due to Senegal's longtime ruling party having a firm grip on power.Violence had broken out in Dakar, the nation's capital, ahead of the election as protesters demanded the resignation of Wade. Several people were killed and hundreds more injured in the clashes.The Organization of the Islamic Conference and the African Union had both called for the peaceful resolution of disputes, and for a free and fair vote. Senegal's government subsequently agreed to allow foreign observers for the election.Despite their presence, however, reports of fraud and irregularities were widespread. The opposition has dismissed the results of the election and has called on supporters to take to the streets in protest.The Supreme Court must still ratify Wade's re-election, although it is widely expected to do so without much issue. If approved, it will be Wade's third term in office, having served since 2000.",

It says the new view will greatly help scientists understand solar storms that can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth. VOA's David McAlary reports.The new 3-D images came from twin NASA spacecraft named STEREO, launched last October. They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart. The separation provides a three dimensional view of the sun, just as the offset in our eyes gives us depth perception.Until the advent of this identical pair of observatories, images from Earth telescopes or orbiting solar telescopes were two dimensional. NASA solar scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta says the three dimensional images will help scientists determine where matter and energy flow in the sun's atmosphere much more precisely.\"We have to move away from the traditional sun-Earth line to view the sun from around, from over the poles, from under the poles to really get a deeper understanding of what is inside the sun, what is coming out of its surface, how is it affecting the entire solar system that we live in,\" said Madhulika Guhathakurta.The main STEREO project scientist, Michael Kaiser, says the satellites' depth perception will help improve space weather forecasts.Of particular concern are powerful eruptions of billions of tons of electrically charged gas that smash into Earth's magnetic field at millions of kilometers per hour.",

The strategy was laid out in a statement by the Obama Foundation which highlighted “the urgent need for the Sudanese people to be given a choice to peacefully transition to a new democratic nation.” It called for Sudan to be unified under a civilian-led transitional government, and for the international community to protect civilians from violence. The new policy has been welcomed by the Enough Project, a US-based group which works to end genocide and crimes against humanity. “The Obama strategy’s emphasis on a civilian-led and fully inclusive transition is a much-needed shift away from the undemocratic and un-inclusive militarily led transition that has been envisioned by the Transitional Military Council,” Enough Project executive director Jonathan Hutson said in a statement.However, Hutson said that a “sustained, aggressive” international effort was needed to ensure the violence in Sudan stops. He called on the United Nations to use its existing powers, such as an arms embargo, to pressure the country into political reform. The Enough Project also warned of the potential for further military violence if “violent spoilers” are not held accountable for human rights abuses. The statement from the Obama Foundation also noted the need for a sustained commitment from the international community to support the political transition in Sudan. It said that this would require “robust multilateral support” and urged world leaders to put pressure on Sudan to make a peaceful transition. The new strategy marks a shift in US policy towards Sudan and is widely seen as a positive step towards ending the country’s decades of conflict. However, many in the international community remain skeptical that a peaceful solution can be reached, and are calling for continued pressure to be placed on the Sudanese government.",

The \"shock and awe\" campaign started on March 20th with allied air strikes against leadership targets as US and British forces rolled across the border from Kuwait.On April 5th, American heavy armor penetrated Baghdad. And today, what fighting remains is largely mopping-up pockets of resistance as the U-S leads the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.How was the war won so quickly? And what are the lessons to be learned?Joining me to examine the Iraq war are: military strategist, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters; and military historian Victor Davis Hanson of California State University in Fresno, Califronia.Victor Hanson, let me begin with you. In your view, what was the key factor in the coalition victory in Iraq?MR. HANSON: I think it was the ability to start the ground war almost simultaneously with the air war that gave some tactical surprise, when it was hard to achieve surprise because of the past record in Afghanistan and Kosovo, where we didn't use sizeable numbers of ground troops. It saved the infrastructure. It undermined the Iraqi command-and-control. And it gave some powerful messages that we still could act without our allies, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia. We sort of envisioned the Iraqis -- the Baathists -- as a snake of sorts that was coiled around the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, and rather than just hacking at the coils, we went straight to Baghdad and tried to decapitate it.MR. MORALES: Ralph Peters, let me put that same question to you.MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with everything that has just been said as far as the operational factors go, but I think there is something even beyond that. This really was a civilizational victory.",

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

The reports highlight that North Korea has been supplying Iran with centrifuges and related technology for uranium enrichment and other key components necessary for a nuclear weapons program. Iran, on the other hand, has been providing North Korea with components and expertise to develop its nuclear weapons. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said, “This report provides evidence of a deeper relationship than previously known, and casts doubt on the value of past denuclearization negotiations.”North Korea's nuclear program is a source of tension in the region, with the international community fearing a possible nuclear conflict on the Korean peninsula. However, the latest reports show the North Korean nuclear program is also a source of cooperation between countries and their nuclear pursuits.

The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",

But smaller and diplomatically isolated Taiwan also claims the disputed Senkaku archipelago, which it calls the Diaoyutai. In Taipei, authorities have shied away from confrontation, while seeking to play a larger role in resolving the conflict. On Tuesday, Taiwanese officials urged Japan and China to back down from a conflict about the Senkaku islets, some 220 kilometers from Taiwan.Taiwan wants Japan to resume talks, after 16 earlier rounds, on fishing rights in waters near the uninhabited islets. Taiwan also asked the other claimants to consider Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s proposal for setting aside their territorial disputes to explore jointly for resources. Foreign Minister Timothy Yang told a news conference in Taipei that he is worried that the conflict will spiral. He says it is easy to escalate a conflict and harder to make peace. But Yang calls Taiwan a peacemaker for the international community and says that, in face of the East China Sea developments, the president has formulated a peace initiative. He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute. When President Ma took office in 2008, he said that despite diplomatic isolation Taiwan would try for more informal participation in international affairs.",

The rural vote appears as divided as it is elsewhere.As Egyptians await the results of their first truly open presidential election, fault lines between Islamists and old guard secularists appear to cut across the nation. In the village of Kafr Kandil, south of Cairo, the choice plays well with the largely conservative rural vote: some seek stability in religion, others in past performance. Many of the latter look to veteran diplomat Amr Moussa, who along with former Air Force chief Ahmed Shafik, promises a return to pre-uprising law and order, minus the corruption. Outside the village school, which is serving as the village polling station, Shadia Ewis, a housewife and mother of five, hopes Moussa wins. She thinks he's a \"respectable man\" who \"could control the country.\" Her friend and fellow housewife, Magda Hassan, agrees. She says she wants Moussa to institute reforms, so that it won't be like it was under the old government, when everything was exploited. Getting a fair shake from the government is a key concern of Islamist candidates' supporters, too. Farmer Ali Hassan Abdel Baki believes the best man for the job is the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi. Sitting in the bright sunshine, his fields of tomatoes and grains behind him, Abdel Baki says \"there is unfinished business.\" He says a lot of people are out of work, and the next leader, \"with God's help, will look after the poor.\"",

In 2018, Brazil had a pension deficit of 626.3 billion reais, which has led many to criticize the current system.Bolsonaro has stated that he wants to tackle the problem on a \"module by module\" basis, focusing on specific parts of the pension system to generate revenue.

In the United States, for example, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has established a network to better understand the factors that contribute to preterm birth and how to prevent it.This data highlights the need for further research and global awareness into the risks of premature births.

A large number of military vehicles, aircraft and ships will be involved, allowing the Russian military to demonstrate its capabilities. This display of Russian military prowess is set to be one of the largest exercises since 1981’s Zapad-81 drills. Troops from China and Mongolia are also expected to participate, making it an even larger undertaking. The drills come at a time when tensions between Russia and the West are at a high. The US and other NATO countries have accused Russia of increased aggression and threatened to impose economic sanctions.

For many living in the region, the two decades-old conflict seems no closer to being resolved.At the center of the dispute is the name “Macedonia,” which Greece considers to be an exclusive part of its own heritage. In Greece, Macedonia has been firmly linked with the ancient kingdom of Alexander the Great. Athens is insistent on the use of an alternate name for the neighboring country of Macedonia.The cultural divide has resulted in a frozen conflict that has threatened the stability of the whole region. Fears are that the intense name dispute between Greece and Macedonia may lead to a deeper political rivalry that could have far-reaching repercussions.The people living on the Greece-Macedonia border, who have been caught in the middle of the dispute for decades, have grown increasingly exasperated and desperate. As the two sides remain deadlocked, people are left with a feeling of helplessness, frustration and loss.Though both sides continue to remain committed to finding a diplomatic resolution to the name dispute, the diplomatic talks have yielded little progress so far. Until an agreement can be reached, the region along the Greek-Macedonia border is likely to remain mired in a climate of uncertainty and a sense of defeat.",

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

The decision was made during a two-day session of the Council of Experts, the highest government body on religious and clerical issues, after much debate over how to ensure a fair process.Yazdi was a prominent figure in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and has held a number of high-level positions within the country's Islamic Republic. In recent years he has also become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the West, including describing the United States as the \"mother of terrorism\".

He also emphasized that the US’s pursuit of justice in bin Laden’s case was only the beginning. \"Today’s achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people,\" said President Obama.Security analysts are also noting the potential impacts of the terrorist leader’s death. Experts believe that al-Qaeda may suffer from a lack of leadership, making it difficult to plan and carry out future operations. However, there are also some dangers associated with bin Laden’s death. Analyst point to the potential for al-Qaeda to retaliate against US and allied targets, as well as increasing pressure on US forces in Afghanistan.In the weeks ahead, the US will continue to evaluate the consequences of bin Laden’s death, and work to protect its citizens and allies from any potential threats.",

The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight. Poland is currently governed by the conservative Law and Justice party led by Kaczynski's twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is intent on finding and punishing those guilty of his brother's death.",

In July, a French military patrol was ambushed in the northern city of Gao; four civilians were killed in a shootout.FILE - A still image taken from a video shot on June 29, 2018, shows damaged buildings inside the headquarters of the G5 Sahel military task force in Sevare, Mali.\"Extremists are a threat to [Malian] democracy, a threat to our way of life,\" said Niankoro Yeah Samake, former Malian ambassador to India and one of the presidential candidates during the last elections.\"Today in Mali, there are people and students who cannot go to school because of insecurity,\" said Aissatou Traore, a student living in Bamako.\"",

        "text": "The United States Senate has voted down a controversial proposed oil pipeline, for now.The Senate voted on Wednesday to reject the construction of a new crude oil pipeline stretching from North Dakota to Illinois. The vote was 55-45, mainly along party lines, as Republicans opposed the project and Democrats supported it.The proposed pipeline, which would transport hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Bakken region in North Dakota, has been met with widespread opposition from both environmental activists and indigenous communities. Critics argue that the project poses a great risk of polluting water sources and damaging sacred tribal land. This is the second time the pipeline proposal has been voted down, with a Senate committee voting against it in March. While Wednesday’s vote was not the final say on the project, it does serve as a major setback for proponents of the pipeline. The rejection of the proposal comes after President Joe Biden revoked a presidential permit for the pipeline in January, effectively cancelling the project. Supporters of the pipeline, including North Dakota’s Republican governor, have argued that the move put thousands of jobs in the region at risk.The long-term fate of the pipeline remains uncertain, but for now, it appears that the controversial project is on hold.",

She has made several visits to Panzi Hospital in the DRC's South Kivu Province, where many rape victims are brought. From Toronto, Canada, she spoke to VOA English to Africa Service reporter Joe De Capua about her impressions when she paid her first visit to the hospital.\"Because of V-day?I've spent the last 10 years traveling to probably 60 and I've spent a lot of time in what I call the rape mines of the world. You know, in Bosnia, in Afghanistan and Haiti and Kosovo. But I have to tell you nothing quite prepared me for the level of violence and atrocities that I heard and witnessed in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" she says.She says that the war has been allowed to continue with impunity, describing the government as non-functional and UN peacekeepers as ineffective. \"Because it's gone on for so long, it's become ordinary. It's become something that's now a part of everyday life. As an activist said there, rape has become a country sport,\" she says.Ensler says estimates put the number of women raped in the eastern DRC in the last 10 years at up to 400,000. \"But the kind of violence that's going on ? the gang rapings, the militias that are released knowing that they have AIDS and released on communities knowing they have STDs?",

Tymoshenko was charged on Tuesday with exceeding her powers in a 2009 gas deal with Russia and was remanded into custody pending trial.Many of those in the crowd yesterday voiced their concerns that her prosecution was politically motivated and did not adhere to the rule of law. Supporters chanted \"Freedom for Yulia!\" and carried flags and banners calling for her release.The Government of Ukraine has said that the charges against Tymoshenko are unrelated to her position as Prime Minister and is part of a wider investigation into corruption. However, many in the opposition believe that the Government is using the investigation as a way of silencing its opponents.The situation has been complicated by the fact that Tymoshenko is the leader of the largest opposition party in Ukraine. This has added further tension to the already strained relationship between the Government and its opponents.The protests continued throughout the day, with more rallies planned in the near future. Tymoshenko's supporters vowed to continue to fight for her release, and said they will not give up until she is free.",

Sharif is in London, along with his children, caring for his wife who is undergoing treatment for cancer.Sharif has denounced the verdict as politically motivated and accused a covert military-judiciary alliance of trying to keep him out of politics and undermining the integrity of his PML-N party to enable alliance favorites to win Pakistan’s upcoming national elections on July 25.",

Last month, the Taliban had launched a major offensive in the northern Afghan province of Badakhshan, which left over 40 Afghan troops dead.The US and other nations remain committed to ending the conflict, but a negotiated settlement is seen as the only way forward. The Taliban must now decide if they want to join the peace process or face further conflict and suffering.",

        "text": "The ongoing debate around global warming has been increasingly driven by politics, rather than science. While the majority of scientific research agrees that the planet is indeed warming due to human activity, there are still a few who hold out and refute the scientific consensus.Partisan politics are a major driving force of this debate, with climate change deniers and supporters often drawn along party lines. As the world begins to grapple with the potentially catastrophic effects of rising temperatures, government policies remain divided along ideological lines.This creates a problem for international progress, as a lack of cohesive policy results in weak global action against the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the science remains clear: temperatures are rising, and the repercussions of this trend are felt across the world.However, a recent survey from the Centre for Public Opinion Research (CEPOS) found that a significant proportion of citizens do not understand the scientific consensus on climate change. This could be attributed to political debates, which often obscure the scientific realities of global warming.Ultimately, it is critical for all sides of the debate to recognize the role of science in the fight against global warming. As the world hurtles towards an uncertain future, it is more important than ever that we understand the facts and draw up an effective plan of action.",
