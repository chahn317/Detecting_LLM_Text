Incumbent President Petro Poroshenko has claimed that exit polls are evidence that he has won, while his opponent Volodymyr Zelensky has also declared himself the winner.The two men have been locked in a tense battle for the presidency since the first round of voting in March. The latest survey, conducted by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, gave Poroshenko a 5% lead over Zelensky, with the incumbent on 53.7%, and Zelensky on 48.7%.However, the Ukrainian Central Election Commission has yet to declare a clear winner. This could mean that the final results may take a few days or weeks to confirm. There are also some concerns that the election was marred by irregularities, which could delay the final announcement even further.With both candidates claiming victory and a high level of uncertainty, tensions remain high in Ukraine. The country is anxiously awaiting a decision from the Election Commission that can settle the dispute and bring some level of stability to the region.",

The explosion occurred deep inside the Zasyadko mine, located near Donetsk in the Donetsk region.Authorities say they believe the cause of the accident was likely methane buildup. The miners were working at a depth of 500-700 metres when the blast occurred.Rescuers and emergency services rushed to the site of the accident in the morning but it took them several hours to reach the group of miners due to the rubble blocking the entrances and exits.",

According to the IMD, Fani had a wind speed of up to 177 kilometers per hour (110 mph).Fani made landfall around 8 a.m. local time in Puri, a city in Odisha. The storm was expected to affect up to 10 million people in India and Bangladesh.Authorities said they evacuated more than a million people from coastal areas of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal in an attempt to minimize casualties.“We are prepared with all essential commodities, relief and rescue materials to face this situation and mitigate the sufferings of people,\" said Odisha’s Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi in a statement.Early reports suggest that power supply and telecommunications services have been disrupted in the region, while the airport in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, has also been shut down.The Indian government has deployed teams of the National Disaster Response Force to help with relief and rescue operations in affected areas.

In recent weeks, thousands of asylum seekers have arrived in the small country, placing a strain on public services and sparking a backlash from certain politicians.Refugees, particularly those from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, are worried about the rhetoric that is being used in Belgium against them. Many fear a roll back of policies which provide them with a safe place to live and work.“It's very worrying to hear people referring to refugees as a 'threat',” said Faisal, a Syrian refugee living in Brussels. “I don't know what is going to happen next. All I want is a safe and secure place to live and work.”The Belgian government has promised to continue to provide assistance to refugees, but some politicians have called for restrictions and tougher security measures. “We must ensure that our borders are secure and that we know who is coming into our country,” said Minister of Immigration, Theo Francken.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has criticized this rhetoric and warned that it could lead to a dangerous atmosphere of xenophobia in the country. “Refugees should be seen as victims of conflict and violence, not as a threat to our security or economy,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “They deserve our protection and assistance.” In the face of increased tensions, refugees are still hoping for a safe place in Belgium. “I just want to be able to live my life in peace,” said Faisal.",

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Gates warned that reducing funding for global development would have “grave consequences” on those most in need.“Reducing the flow of resources to poor countries may be seen as necessary for fiscal policy, but it would be a tragedy,\" Gates said.He cited data from the World Bank indicating that the number of people living in extreme poverty had been cut in half in the last decade. Gates credited this decline to investment in health and education through international development programs.“If these resources and the progress they’ve enabled are not sustained, many of the gains we’ve achieved will be reversed,\" Gates said.Gates called for governments to ensure that there is adequate funding for global health initiatives, agricultural research, and family planning programs. He said that the current economic climate should not deter investment in global development.\"The worst thing we could do in this moment of fiscal uncertainty is to get complacent or worse, turn a blind eye, to the suffering and obstacles we can alleviate with smart investments in development,\" he said.",

Recent years have seen an increase in violence and instability, leading to a situation in which the government struggles to maintain control of even its capital, Kabul.It is against this backdrop that President Joe Biden is now considering a new strategy. Biden has signaled that he is open to the idea of a reduced US military presence in Afghanistan, with a focus on counterterrorism operations as well as diplomatic and economic pressure.Several regional leaders have backed the idea of a reduced US footprint in Afghanistan, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has called for \"a peace process without preconditions that brings an end to the conflict and establishes a government able to protect its citizens and deny safe haven to terrorists.\"However, it remains to be seen what the new strategy will be and how it will be implemented. A number of questions remain, including whether the Taliban will be willing to negotiate and what kind of political settlement might be possible. As the situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, attention will no doubt intensify further on the strategy that the US and its allies decide to pursue.",

        "text": "In a landmark ruling on Thursday, the US Supreme Court determined that police must obtain a warrant before tracking an individual's cellphone location. The 5-4 decision delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts found that, when considering an individual's \"legitimate expectations of privacy,\" a warrant is required for the government to access such sensitive information.The case in question, Carpenter v. US, revolved around the conviction of Timothy Carpenter, who was accused of several armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio in 2011 and 2012. The FBI relied on evidence obtained by accessing 127 days worth of Carpenter's cellphone records, pinpointing his location and establishing his presence near the crime scenes. Carpenter argued that this amounted to an illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts agreed, stating that \"when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone...it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone’s user.\" In his dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argued that the decision was too sweeping, going beyond the Fourth Amendment's original scope. The court's ruling will likely have a huge impact on law enforcement in the US, as cellphone location records are increasingly used in criminal investigations. Technology companies, too, are likely to be affected, as some have been known to store location records for upwards of seven years. Nevertheless, the ruling establishes a precedent that places strong emphasis on protecting individual privacy in the digital age.",

Rachid Redouane, who also died in the attack, had worked as a pastry chef in Ireland and was of Moroccan and Libyan descent. The third attacker was Italian national Youssef Zaghba, who had been living in east London.The trio drove a hired van across London Bridge on Saturday night, plowing through pedestrians in a rampage before crashing at Borough Market. Armed with hunting knives, they began attacking people, resulting in the deaths of seven people and the injuries of 48 others, some of whom are still in a critical condition.Police have yet to establish a motive for the attack, but have confirmed that all three men were part of the same terrorist cell. Several properties have been searched in connection with the attack and arrests made.The attack was the third to hit Britain this year. In March, a man drove into people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer. Four people died in that attack and many more were injured.

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be? I am certain it will be John's.''Said House Speaker Paul Ryan, ``His legacy is so long that John McCain is a hero to us all.''",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",
