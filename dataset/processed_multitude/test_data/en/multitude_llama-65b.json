Bush.Britain’s ambassador to Egypt, Sir Derek Plumbly, described the situation in the impoverished territory as “horrendous.”Speaking to the BBC, he added: “One cannot understand the situation in Gaza until you have been to Gaza and seen the way in which it’s been developed, with a very high density of population, and the pressure on the basic infrastructure and the humanitarian needs are obviously immense.”The United Nations says that more than a quarter of Gaza’s 1.5 million people are in urgent need of food.Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met for hours Friday for indirect talks, but left without reaching a truce deal, according to Palestinian and Egyptian officials.Israel announced that it would allow shipments of humanitarian aid into Gaza beginning Friday afternoon through the Sufa crossing, and that an Egyptian medical team would enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. The Israeli military announced the move after Defense Minister Ehud Barak approved the Red Cross’s request to enter Gaza to provide medical treatment and humanitarian aid to Palestinians hurt in the fighting. The Israeli military said the Red Cross would transfer dozens of tons of medical supplies into Gaza.On Friday, an estimated 130 trucks entered Gaza via the Karni crossing, according to a statement from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, part of the Israeli military.But an Associated Press reporter at Karni witnessed just four trucks crossing over in the afternoon. And a British truck loaded with blankets and other goods was turned back.It was not immediately clear whether the truck was denied entry by Israel or by Hamas militants. Palestinian witnesses said that Hamas security would not let the truck pass, saying it had not coordinated its arrival with Hamas. The truck then drove back into Israel.The U.",

Credit: AFPCHIANG RAI – Thailand has seen a large increase in household debt in recent decades, which along with other factors is weighing on consumer spending, and which could hurt the economy’s prospects in future.The country’s population is aging fast and so are the householders who owe the debts. The combination is making it harder for indebted Thais to pay down their debts and for banks to get them off the books – potentially hitting an economy that is heavily reliant on consumer spending.The average age of debtors in the country has increased in the past six years to about 48 in 2013, from 44 in 2007, according to Bank of Thailand data.“The debt problem will get worse, because people over 40 have less ability to work and earn money,” said Supavud Saicheua, director of the Social Research Institute at Thailand’s Chiang Mai University.“They’ll have to borrow more in order to survive, so it will be hard to get rid of the debt.”The average debt per household member in Thailand increased to 47,637 baht (about $1,400) in 2013, up from 37,503 baht six years earlier, central bank data shows.Most of Thailand’s debt is held by consumers, a fact that is worrying economists, who warn that unless the loans are cleared soon, the debt-burden will limit the spending power of Thai consumers.Household debt grew 10 percent to more than 8 trillion baht in the second quarter from the first quarter, according to the central bank.",

And I’m quite certain that there will be a small number of Democrats who also vote to acquit,” Mr. Morris said in an appearance on Fox News. “So I think the articles of impeachment will be rejected.”Several top Democrats have vowed to subpoena current and former Trump administration officials to testify in the trial.Mr. Morris, who also served as an adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, predicted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would reject Democrats’ attempts to compel testimony.“I think McConnell will stand firm and say no witnesses,” he said.Mr. Morris also suggested he thinks impeachment will do more damage to Democrats than to Mr. Trump, given the high approval ratings of the U.S. economy.“I think this will backfire on [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi] in a bad way, because I don’t think anybody was much interested in impeachment,” he said.“Now we get to see what the case is for the impeachment and I think that’s going to backfire on the Democrats,” he added.⦁ Victor Morton contributed to this reportPelosi says ‘No one is above the law,’ not even herselfHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman behind the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, was a bit taken aback Thursday when a reporter pointed out that she herself is not in a position to lecture others on the rule of law.After a press conference during which she insisted repeatedly that “nobody is above the law,” Ms. Pelosi was asked why she is blocking Rep.",

At the same time, the anti-terrorist coalition hit front-line Taliban troops with the largest wave of bombs to date.The raid was coordinated with ground troops from the Northern Alliance, who took over the refinery on the outskirts of the key northern city.Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced the change in tactics at a Pentagon news conference late Wednesday. He said coalition forces now have the ability to target Taliban and al-Qaida forces on the front lines.\"We have shifted a bit in that we have begun to do more direct action against enemy forces on the battlefield in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"This shift has been dictated by changes in the condition on the ground, in Afghanistan.\"The secretary said the new tactics involve the deployment of more airlifted U.S. forces into the theater, a move that had been delayed because of concerns about the security of airbases in the region.The move also reflects the U.S. decision to increase its presence in the north, an area controlled by the country's main rebel group, the Northern Alliance. U.S. commandos have joined Northern Alliance troops in several raids in recent days, and Pentagon officials say that joint teams have also been established to gather intelligence.At his Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said he would not speculate about when the Taliban will collapse. But asked about reports the Taliban may already be in the process of surrendering the capital, Kabul, Mr. Rumsfeld said the Northern Alliance's ability to take control of the city may be compromised by the presence of Taliban units and foreign fighters in other parts of the country.",

State television has shown the last 60 years of communist rule in a glorious light with parades, fireworks and even a song and dance by Chinese soldiers.President Hu Jintao boasted of his nation's success on the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic.\"China has not only developed itself, it has also made great contributions to the prosperity of the world and mankind,\" Hu said in his national speech.But while Hu may be able to look back at years of strong growth in China's economy and rising wealth of many Chinese, it hasn't exactly been a great decade for dissent, and the trend is certainly not one of increasing freedom in China. (See the 100 most endangered species.)Following the outpouring of protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, China's Communist Party embarked on a campaign to modernize the economy without opening up the political system. Twenty years later, the Party — which controls all the levers of state power — seems to be even more entrenched in its view that democracy has no place in China.In 2002, the Party drafted a law governing the treatment of prisoners of conscience. Article 5 in the draft regulations states that the country would \"ensure that no citizen suffers discrimination or harm due to his or her political views.\" That line is absent from the Party's recently updated draft, published on Aug. 31. Article 5 is also more restrictive than its predecessor, emphasizing the need to suppress \"all activities that use evil cults or superstition to disrupt the implementation of the law.\" (See pictures of China's Three Gorges Dam.)",

This has resulted in a weakening of the central government.The tribal system, however, has remained untouched by the coup. This system was the main source of support for President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi when he resigned.The Houthis wanted to make the tribal system an alternative to the official government, and this is why they tried to build alliances with the tribes, or at least certain figures within the tribes.In fact, this was one of the Houthis' primary mistakes. Tribes do not belong to individuals, and the tribal system itself does not give them the right to make political decisions.Furthermore, a tribe's authority does not automatically include a ruler, which was a fundamental factor in the Houthis' failure. The tribes want a strong central government and do not accept the Houthis' coup, and this explains why the government has so far retained the majority of tribes' support.There have been reports about battles between pro-government and pro-Houthi tribesmen.",

When the dams are built, the Nile will be held back upstream and flow patterns will be altered, causing a shortage of water in downstream areas. According to Egyptian rice farmer, Ashraf Abu El Yazid,Egyptian rice farmers are already seeing a decline in crop yields due to lack of water.the farmers in his village will “lose everything” if the water flow is interrupted.Abdel Moneim al-Sa’idi, another rice farmer in the village of Basioun in Gharbiyah, Egypt, also reported feeling uncertain about the future, saying that “people are scared and the problem is widespread.” The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture stated that rice production has already dropped from one million tons to 800,000 tons due to the decline in water flow in the Nile.Already Egypt has been forced to buy more than $1 million in rice from abroad to maintain an appropriate stockpile of the crop, according to Almasry Alyoum, and Egyptian economists warn that the rice farmers may lose their livelihoods as they watch their crop yield diminish. Rice farmer Abdel Halim Ouda told Almasry Alyoum that the crop has already decreased by 30 percent and that “we can’t do anything about it except be patient.”",

It also appeared on the South China Morning Post.China has long used the “one China principle” as a diplomatic litmus test for countries seeking closer ties to Beijing, warning that formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan would undermine relations.However, U.S.-Taiwan relations have expanded so substantially in recent years that some suggest the U.S. could very soon take a major step that has been taboo for decades—formally recognizing the sovereign Republic of China on Taiwan.Taiwan’s relations with the U.S. hit a high point at the end of the Obama administration, but they are reaching new highs under Donald Trump.This expansion began quietly during the Obama administration, which signaled its support for Taiwan’s new diplomatic strategies to expand its international engagement.It grew to new levels with the election of Donald Trump, who has appointed officials known for their support of Taiwan and who personally has suggested that the U.S. might abandon the “one China” policy in the future.Tsai Ing-wen’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is traditionally more favorable to independence, won both the presidential and parliamentary elections in Taiwan in early 2016.Since then, Tsai and her government have promoted new diplomatic strategies for enhancing Taiwan’s relations with countries around the world.One of the pillars of these new strategies is “substantive relations” with the U.S., a term Taiwan has embraced for many years but never fully implemented.Under this new approach, Taiwanese leaders would visit the U.S. more often and meet U.S. government officials, including at high levels.These officials, in turn, would visit Taiwan more often. The two sides would hold talks and negotiate agreements on practical issues, such as technology sharing, and participate in joint military and training exercises.It is not just the Tsai government pushing forward on Taiwan-U.S. relations.",

Although the DPJ has a new leader, former Defense Agency Director General Yukio Hatoyama, a new secretary general is about to be appointed. According to informed sources, Naoto Kan, the former Health and Welfare Minister, will assume the position in September.Kan will be the first Cabinet minister from either party to be named secretary general. In 1988, he established the Democratic Reform Party of Japan, which merged with the DPJ and is now the DPJ.Kan, who has been involved in politics longer than any of his colleagues, is the top candidate for the post. His appointment would represent a major step toward realizing the merger of the two parties.Kan’s decision to take the secretary-general post was announced in June when the merger of the DPJ and Liberal Party was announced. But he also said that he would not do so if the merger failed. Now that the merger has succeeded, he has said he intends to honor his promise.Aside from Kan, the names of former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and the DPJ Upper House member Kojiro Ishii have come up as possible secretary-general candidates. Although Nakayama appears to have a good chance of being picked, the party has not finalized its choice of secretaries and other officials yet. It has yet to determine the composition of the executive, the Standing Executive Committee and the General Assembly.The DPJ has a total of 114 Diet members, including 71 from the Liberal Party.

The article was published on February 8th.“The foreign aid budget in the United States is less than 1 percent of the federal budget and is only about 0.2 percent of GDP,” he told the news agency. “These budgets are not huge, particularly relative to the scale of the United States economy. The idea of cutting it at a time when you still have so much need is just crazy.”The Obama Administration is currently working to trim a record $1.5 trillion budget deficit.Reuters noted that “Gates was speaking at the launch in London of a $450 million fund to protect children in developing countries against pneumonia and diarrhoea, the top two killers of children under the age of five. The fund is being provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to Gavi, an international organisation that brings together developing country governments, donor governments, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, UNICEF and the World Health Organization. Gates’s foundation has given $1.5 billion to the Gavi alliance since 2000.”Gates expressed concern over cuts to global health programs, including a 48% reduction in funding for malaria vaccines, as well as UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund.The U.S. provides approximately one-quarter of UNFPA’s budget, and cuts to this agency’s funding have in the past had a huge impact on its efforts to address the needs of women and girls in many countries.“When you see the huge cuts to foreign aid in the House of Representatives, in the initial [legislation] there are dramatic changes,” said Gates. “This is the time to be generous.”",

Soft US data contrast with generally firmer readings abroad, highlighting the case for a gradual unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet and limited prospects of the FOMC moving quickly in raising policy rates. For the Fed, the deterioration of recent US data would likely require further improvement in global growth.Fed Policy Gradual, but Risk Remains of Early Unwinding of Balance SheetThe FOMC statement and forecasts released following the March meeting on 15 March struck a positive tone, but the Fed’s updated forecasts revealed a less aggressive stance on interest rates than indicated in December. Given the Fed’s intention to move the policy rate to more normal levels while at the same time reducing the size of its balance sheet, the prospects of more than three additional rate hikes over the next two years seems unlikely. Indeed, if the Fed begins to reduce the size of its balance sheet later this year, this could result in a more hawkish stance by the FOMC.Retail Sales WeakThe March retail sales report was weak. Headline retail sales fell short of expectations and the level of sales relative to spending is now at the lowest in more than two years (Figure 1). While the level of retail sales is volatile, the trend has declined in recent years (Figure 2). Although the level of retail sales is only about 1% below trend, the risks of a deeper retrenchment in spending now seems greater, in our view.Figure 1 – US Retail Sales Disappoint in MarchSource: US Department of CommerceFigure 2 – Declining Trend in US Retail SalesWeakness in the March retail sales report followed a disappointing first quarter reading in the March US consumer sentiment index released a week earlier.",

Ritu, a Wharton School and IIT-IIM alumna, has been an entrepreneur for 10 years, while Shreya is a first-generation entrepreneur and has recently completed her class 12 board exams.Asked why she started so young, Shreya answered, “I don’t think being young is stopping me from pursuing my dreams. When I was 16 years old, I got the opportunity to visit Israel, which is a very startup-friendly country. This was a life-changing experience for me as I got a chance to network with several successful startup owners. This was the beginning of my dream.”While both the entrepreneurs have different challenges in their entrepreneurial journey, they share the same aspiration of making a social impact through their startups. LetsMD is a healthcare fin-tech platform that brings transparency in the healthcare loan space and makes it easier for individuals to access finance for critical illnesses. While InnoCirc is an incubator that aims to help incubate student startups and bring a positive impact on the society.Shreya has co-founded two startups to date, one of which was acquired by Sunstone Capital. She now aims to develop a platform that provides mentorship and funding to startups led by college students.",

Additionally, the plan will allow borrowers to cap their loan payments at 10 percent of discretionary income. It will also give borrowers the ability to consolidate both federal and private undergraduate loans.Officials have said the changes are designed to help borrowers, who carry an average debt load of $23,300, better manage repayment of their student loans. According to some reports, college graduates spend 30 percent of their discretionary income on loan payments.The announcement comes a week before Obama’s scheduled speech at the University of Michigan’s commencement ceremony, where he is expected to tout the program as part of a plan to make the dream of a college education more accessible and affordable to Americans.The changes to the income-based repayment plan, created by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2007, could benefit as many as 1.6 million borrowers, including 65,000 who have more than one loan, according to White House estimates.Some Republicans have raised concerns about how the Obama administration plans to pay for the changes. The plan also includes expanding an existing program, started by Obama in 2010, that forgives outstanding debt for certain borrowers after 20 years.",

Jambon allegedly said, \"I'm just telling it like it is: immigrants cause higher crime rates.\" Credit: Creative Commons.by Laura Daley and Jillian GibersonThe recent terror attack in London has put Belgium’s Deputy Prime Minister Jan Jambon on the defensive after he said refugees in the country often end up in jail.Last year, in the wake of a series of terrorist attacks in Brussels, Jambon came under fire for saying he wanted to deport convicted terrorists.At the time, he claimed that all 135,000 asylum seekers in the country should be vetted for terror connections. This, he claimed, was “for the sake of the security of our citizens.”A little over a year later, he is facing similar heat, including from members of his own party, over his recent comments about how refugees have an unfavourable impact on society.On Tuesday, Jambon, who was visiting the Belgian coastal city of Zeebrugge, was quoted as saying, “I’m just telling it like it is: immigrants cause higher crime rates.”He pointed to statistics in Belgium’s second-largest city Antwerp that showed asylum seekers accounted for 10 per cent of the population but committed 60 to 70 per cent of the crime.His comments came a day after a terror attack in London that killed four people, including the attacker, and injured more than 40.The attacker was identified as Khalid Masood, a British man who, according to reports, used to be a teacher.In response to Jambon’s comments, Belgium’s Interior Minister, Jan Jambon, said Jambon had a point, but that linking immigrants to crime was a “stigmatization.”",

He added that he will leave the court effective July 31.Kennedy's retirement leaves an opening for Trump to nominate a second justice to the nine-member court. If the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, confirms the president's pick before the court's next term begins in October, the new justice would be in place when the court begins its next term in October.The court is now poised to tilt markedly to the right with Trump having appointed Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and now being in a position to replace retiring Kennedy. That could affect a variety of issues including abortion, gay rights, business regulations and presidential powers.Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals in key cases, has been pivotal in legalizing abortion, preserving affirmative action and legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.His replacement by Trump could make the court solidly conservative for years to come. A Trump appointee could become a pivotal vote on the court for decades.\"It has been the greatest honor and privilege to serve our nation in the federal judiciary for 43 years, 30 of those years on the Supreme Court,\" Kennedy, 81, said in a statement.Kennedy was a critical swing vote on the court for more than a decade.

If unaddressed, they can lead to a vicious cycle of repeated and even worsening violations.“Human rights violations are part of the conflict that we are seeing throughout the Middle East. We are witnessing the death of multicultural, multi-religious societies and we need to reconstruct those societies and not allow them to disappear.”Zeid said the world should make every effort to protect human rights and prevent further bloodshed, and that the international community must ensure the safety of people in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and other regions of conflict. He urged the countries in the region to ensure accountability for those responsible for the abuses.“Human rights violations are part of the conflict that we are seeing throughout the Middle East,” he said. “We are witnessing the death of multicultural, multi-religious societies and we need to reconstruct those societies and not allow them to disappear.”In Yemen, he said, the continuing fighting and escalation of human rights violations are a “horrifying testimony to the devastation and bloodshed” caused by war. Over the last two months, the war has killed more than 1,200 civilians, wounded 5,000 and forced more than 500,000 people from their homes.“This is a time for action, for justice and for accountability,” Zeid said. “We must stop the vicious cycle of oppression and violence.

Still others have labeled it ethnic cleansing.To mark this anniversary we're revisiting the stories of two young Darfuri women who are trying to rebuild their lives in eastern Chad.We're doing this through the eyes of Sally Donnelly, an NPR reporter who traveled to the region as part of an International Reporting Project delegation this past summer.Our reporting partners for this trip include The International Reporting Project and the Darfur Peace and Development Organization.Here, Donnelly talks about the two young women she met in this war torn region:Najma and Hawa don't know how old they are. They don't know their birthdays. They are both in their late teens. They are both in their last year of high school in the Treguine Refugee Camp in eastern Chad.",

        "text": "By Aurel Braun, professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto.The global liberal order may be coming to an end, or perhaps only to a crossroads. A number of countries in Eastern and Western Europe—including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Austria—are displaying tendencies toward illiberal democracy, meaning the substitution of democracy for liberalism. This could portend a significant shift in the geopolitics of Europe, as well as a serious challenge to global liberalism.Illiberal democracy means that the majority of citizens elect governments on the basis of a genuinely open, free, and fair election. That electoral process ensures that the leadership will reflect the will of the majority of citizens.But while the majority may get its preferred government, it does not get liberalism, which embodies political pluralism and individual and minority rights, including protection of property, the rule of law, independent media, and a vibrant civil society.To be clear, a government with majoritarian rule, but also liberal principles, is a liberal democracy; and a government without majoritarian rule, but with liberal principles, is an illiberal liberal order. What makes an illiberal democracy different is that the citizens get to choose their government, but their liberties are at risk.The global liberal order may be coming to an end, or perhaps only to a crossroads.Illiberal democracy is the worst of both worlds. It may have popular legitimacy, but that popular legitimacy comes at the expense of individual rights and freedoms. Citizens can change their government, but they do not necessarily get liberalism.The current illiberal tendencies in Europe should be understood in light of the historical trend in this region and the world more generally.",

The Chinese boat arrived at the lagoon early on Wednesday, April 11, to take over the position of the Chinese fishing vessel F/B Min Zhu Yuan 00807, which had sailed into Scarborough Shoal on April 8 in a show of force, the AFP News agency reports.The stand-off between the Philippines Navy and a Chinese fishing vessel at the Scarborough Shoal, or Bajo de Masinloc, 124 nautical miles off the Philippines’ main island of Luzon and within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), began on April 8. The Philippine Navy sent its largest warship, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, to prevent the Chinese fishing boat from entering the area, according to a report published by the BBC on April 12.The BBC report states that a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel, Zhonggou Haijian 75, tried to prevent the Philippine Navy ship from entering the shoal.

Mao Zedong, the mercurial Chinese communist leader who established the People's Republic of China in 1949 and ruled over a generation of Chinese people, died in 1976. Yet nearly three decades later, the Chinese public still isn't completely allowed to remember the man, even if he does rest beneath a granite mausoleum at the heart of the nation's capital. China's Communist Party leaders have tried to strike a balance between extolling Mao's virtues — he did, after all, establish the People's Republic — and vilifying his excesses — millions of people were persecuted in the Cultural Revolution, a period of political madness that Mao unleashed from 1966 to 1976.That ambivalence toward Mao's life and works was again evident on Dec. 2 — the Chinese leader's birthday, or so party bosses say — when authorities at Renmin University in Beijing detained Luo Haiqing, a well known left-wing student activist who had been calling on people to remember Mao. \"We think he is a good man, and he fought for the liberation of China,\" says Ren Jianming, a 21-year-old classmate of Luo's. \"But if we put up posters or write articles, the police will come to arrest us.\"That's not always the case.",

French prosecutors have said that Mr. Lubitz, 27, suffered from depression and was receiving medical treatment.EasyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa, and Air Berlin, Europe’s largest discount and network carriers, said they would set up confidential 24-hour hotlines for pilots to report colleagues who exhibit signs of mental distress and to seek assistance for themselves.The efforts illustrate how the airlines, which have been forced to cut costs in the face of heavy competition, are grappling with how to ensure their flight crews are mentally fit. Germanwings, a low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa, recently had cut health insurance premiums for its pilots and other crew in a cost-cutting move.Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said Wednesday he didn’t see any link between the insurance issue and the Germanwings crash, and said the move was necessary to stay competitive.“If we hadn’t made this decision, then the whole company, the whole group, would have been in trouble,” Mr. Spohr said at a press conference in Tokyo. “I don’t believe that this would have had any influence on the accident.”Airlines are facing tough trade-offs as they seek to contain employee expenses while ensuring the safety of their passengers.“",

One of those dishes was the chicken tikka masala served at the White House dinner (see recipe below). This popular dish, which originated in the Punjab region of India, can be ordered in just about every Indian restaurant, as well as in Indian neighborhood grocery stores where they sell frozen versions.Chicken tikka masala originated in an Indian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, in the 1970's. The dish is actually two dishes, \"chicken tikka,\" which is boneless chicken grilled in a tandoor (a clay oven), and a \"masala\" sauce, a tomato cream sauce containing spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger and chili peppers. This dish is a modern example of how Indian cuisine absorbed influences from other cultures over many centuries of trade with the Middle East, Britain, Portugal and other parts of Asia.The Chicken tikka masala recipe below makes enough for two meals -- the sauce can be frozen.",

But, he added that any Palestinian government including members of Hamas would be incompatible with the United States and its allies in their fight against terrorism. \"We think that if Hamas were to play a role in the government of the Palestinian Authority, it would be difficult for us to deal with that government, because Hamas has claimed responsibility for terrorist acts against Israelis,\" he said. \"They have called for the destruction of the state of Israel. They have also spoken out against any peace agreement between the two parties.\"Meanwhile, in Washington, a senior U.N. official who has long monitored the Israeli-Palestinian conflict called on the Bush administration to play a more active role in resolving the conflict. Alvaro De Soto, the U.N.'s special coordinator for the Middle East, told the House International Relations Committee, the United States needs to use its influence to help bring peace to the region. \"I believe the United States has a key role to play in advancing towards this goal (of establishing a Palestinian state),\" he said. \"The role of the Quartet (the U.S. the European Union, the United Nations and Russia) in coordinating international efforts for ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state is an important one. But, ultimately, the Quartet, on its own, cannot deliver that goal, and therefore it is to the United States, and in particular its role as part of the Quartet, that we are now looking for a decisive shift in policy and in focus.\"For months, the United States has been trying to advance the so-called \"roadmap\" peace plan for the Middle East.",

Many Chinese people are drawn to the genre because of its combination of singing and dancing with drama and an emphasis on plot.In August, a Chinese production of The Sound of Music opened in Beijing. The New York Times described the show as being “packed with enough special effects, scenic transitions and lighting cues to challenge a small army of stagehands — something of a miracle in China, where all labor, skilled or otherwise, is expensive.”Much of the dialogue in the production was translated into Chinese, but some of the songs were left in English. The Beijing version also included additional musical numbers from the film, including “I Have Confidence,” as well as new songs that were translated into Chinese.According to The New York Times, The Sound of Music will run in Beijing for at least one year. It will then move on to Shanghai and Hong Kong.In September, Chinese audiences were treated to a musical revue called Broadway, I Love You!, which was an extravaganza of scenes and songs from over 30 shows. This included songs from the classic musicals Hello, Dolly!, Evita, and Dreamgirls. The song “Fugue for Tinhorns” from Guys and Dolls was also included.Broadway, I Love You! was a production of Shanghai Media Group, and featured stars of Chinese stage and screen, with music produced by a 26-piece orchestra. In the song “Money Makes the World Go Round,” the lyrics “Money is the best / For all the rest” were changed to “Piano is the best / For all the rest.” According to The New York Times, this was a reference to the recent purchase of the Steinway piano company by John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire.This fall, the musical Dreamgirls will also open in Beijing.",

The new film, My Nappy Roots, shows that natural hair is the way to go and offers inspiration for those who are transitioning from straightening their hair to letting it curl.Written, produced and directed by independent filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (“House Party,” “The Great White Hype”) and narrated by Chadwick Boseman (“42”), the film also features commentary by Chris Rock and Raven-Symoné, as well as other known figures and celebrities.The documentary explores the issue of African American self-identity as seen through the lens of hair, and how many black people feel they are expected to have a more European look.“It was a real pleasure to work with these great artists to create the ultimate celebration of black hair. This documentary explores the roots of black hair and the issues that arise from those roots,” said Hudlin.The documentary highlights the journey many blacks take to self-acceptance.“Our film is also a celebration of black hair in its natural state. We wanted to take on the idea that good hair means straight hair and suggest that in fact good hair is healthy hair, whatever its texture,” said Hudlin.Alicia Keys is executive producer, Jill Newhouse Calcaterra is supervising producer, and Lisa Cortés (“The Wood,” “Precious”), Hudlin’s producing partner, is co-producer of the film.“Hair is an extension of self. It can be a burden or a pleasure. I know mine has been both. But today, when I walk the streets of New York, I see more and more black women loving and rocking their natural hair.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON – As North Korean troops have mobilized near the South Korean border, threatening war, U.S. nuclear analysts have expressed doubt about the regime’s ability to effectively launch a nuclear weapon.Though the world still fears the reclusive nation’s ability to attack through conventional warfare and, in a worst-case scenario, launch a non-conventional nuclear attack, experts who spoke to CQ Roll Call pointed out the technological barriers for such an attack.“North Korea can probably mount a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile and shoot it at something,” said Jon Wolfsthal, nuclear security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The big question is, can they actually explode the warheads? North Korea is making progress, but not there yet.”“That said, we don’t really know what they can do,” Wolfsthal said. “They’ve hidden their capabilities really well and we should assume they can do more than they’ve shown.”In 2009, then-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that the “DPRK may already have that capability” to mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile. In an email interview with CQ Roll Call this week, Gates said it’s a “reasonable inference” to expect that the country could launch a successful attack.“This is a key point and it explains why we keep looking for a way to reduce the North’s arsenal of nuclear weapons,” said Gates, who is co-author of the recently released memoir “Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.” “The more warheads they have, the greater the risk that they would be able to mount and detonate them on their missiles.”In fact, U.S. officials who spoke to CQ Roll Call said the greatest fear comes from the possibility of a conventional attack, not a nuclear one.“No one believes North Korea is in a position to launch a nuclear weapon capable of doing a lot of damage to anyone,” said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, which advocates for nuclear security.",

He isolated her from her family and friends. Patrick controlled the family finances and there was evidence that he made threats to Grace and physically assaulted her on some occasions.“It would be no exaggeration to say that Patrick was a violent bully with a controlling nature.”",

They still earn less than $200 a month.It has been difficult for me to accept that there are no drugs, there are no this and that and I am a qualified doctor but I can’t help my patients because there is no this and that, so I am actually humiliated, Mthabisi Bebhe, a spokesperson for the group, said. The reason why I decided to be a doctor is to save lives and to see my patients suffer, it actually broke my heart.‘Save lives’He said if Zimbabwe’s new government, led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, did not increase wages, more of the country’s medical professionals would leave. That has been happening over the past decades.This strike is to restore the dignity of the medical profession and also to really just say enough is enough with everything that is obtaining currently with the way that we are being treated as doctors.",

The reduction will take effect at the beginning of the new year.The Reserve Bank Governor, Duvvuri Subbarao, said that inflation has remained at elevated levels, and that there are some upside risks to the current inflationary outlook.Even though the central bank in India has raised interest rates a stunning 13 times in the last 18 months, inflation remains above 9 percent. India is trying to balance the need to stimulate economic growth with keeping inflation in check.Analysts warn however, that this is a delicate balancing act. For instance, there is concern that the recent increase in interest rates and reduced cash reserve ratio might actually end up inflaming inflation.",

Over the past year, UNMEER has made a significant contribution to the global response to the Ebola epidemic by playing a critical role in assisting our international and national partners in the fight against the disease. The Mission has served as a key player in international coordination, helped to scale-up a critical workforce, supported the logistical infrastructure for international and national actors, and worked with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and others to create an Emergency Response Platform that has served as a framework for coordinating the recovery effort.As the crisis in Liberia continues to stabilize, now is the time for the international community to turn its focus to helping the government and people of Liberia to recover and rebuild the health systems, economy and society that the epidemic disrupted.During her meeting last week with Secretary General Ban and President Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power made clear that we cannot be complacent even as the epidemic declines. The threat of future outbreaks remains, and we must continue to make use of the lessons we are learning in the current response to ensure that countries are better prepared and able to rapidly control future outbreaks.Toward this end, Ambassador Power announced that the United States will invest an additional $5 million in support of WHO, FAO, and the West African Health Organization to help strengthen preparedness and response capacity in at-risk countries in the region. We look forward to working with WHO and FAO as they help countries in the region develop strategies and prepare the infrastructure, equipment, and materials needed to respond to an Ebola outbreak.But it is not enough to focus our efforts and resources solely on containment.",

In addition to combat-related deaths, civilians were also killed in the latest violence, including two young girls who were apparently caught in the crossfire.Officials in Colombo say Tamil Tiger guerrillas killed 22 soldiers and an unspecified number of civilians in an ambush of an army convoy in the district of Anuradhapura. They say the Tigers also kidnapped at least 14 soldiers.In addition, officials in the rebel-held town of Pottuvil say at least two Tamil civilians were killed in a government shelling attack on the area.Government officials were not immediately available to confirm the information and independent verification is not possible because most of northern and eastern Sri Lanka is under Tamil rebel control.Human rights groups have expressed alarm at the toll being taken on civilian life during the renewed fighting. In the last six months of 2002, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch estimates at least 300 people were killed, including 141 civilians.Since 1995, Norwegian mediators have been trying to broker a peace deal between the two sides, but negotiations collapsed last year and a new round of talks does not appear imminent.",

On November 7th, he attacked CNN’s Jim Acosta at a press conference, calling him a “rude, terrible person.”The White House later suspended Acosta’s press pass. The network filed a legal action and a federal judge ordered the pass reinstated. But the Trump administration has called for new rules to govern press conferences.The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press wrote, “This is the first time in memory that a White House press conference has been used to announce punitive actions against a reporter.”In the past, U.S. presidents criticized some news coverage. But they rarely challenged a reporter’s ability to do his or her job.CNN’s chief Jeff Zucker said, “This is a test for all of us. Do we stand up against this kind of behavior, which is not acceptable from the leader of any country, let alone the United States?

But it has been revised by language, agreed to during three days of intensive negotiations, that is supposed to clear away obstacles to a resumption of the inspections, which broke down four years ago.The new text says there should be a new arrangement between Iraq and the UN, which would require Iraq to submit a declaration of all its weapons of mass destruction programs within 30 days after the new inspection body is put in place.U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte says that arrangement should be designed by the UN with Iraq's approval, but it must be consistent with the obligations set down in previous Security Council resolutions.\"Therefore, for example,\" he said, \"Iraq must provide inspectors with immediate and unrestricted access to all sites and people in Iraq that they wish to inspect, and also provide the inspectors with immediate and unfettered access to any site or people that they suspect may be related to proscribed weapons programs.\"Ambassador Negroponte's French counterpart, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, welcomed the unanimous vote.

Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) by urging world leaders to make every effort to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).The MDGs, a series of eight international development goals established by U.N. member states in 2000, are to be achieved by the target date of 2015.Ban told the commission that Asia has been a major success story in recent years, but the Asian region also faces challenges. The secretary general said he wants Asian governments to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs with the following priorities:• To put job creation at the forefront of their development policy as a means of promoting equitable growth;• To improve governance and reduce corruption;• To promote the role of women in development; and• To develop renewable sources of energy and expand clean energy technologies, with a focus on energy efficiency.Ban called on the assembled leaders to seize the opportunity to mobilize public support to ensure that the United Nations continues to play a leading role in the region and that its vision for inclusive and sustainable development is achieved.ESCAP's mission is to foster economic cooperation and integrate disadvantaged states in Asia and the Pacific, particularly those with landlocked, island or mountainous developing economies.ESCAP's current membership comprises 62 regional member States, nine associate members, and three of the UN's five Regional Economic and Social Commissions, namely the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Economic Commission for Africa, and the Economic Commission for Europe.Through the ESCAP secretariat, the commission is mandated to provide a forum for all the countries of the region to review and discuss the development issues and activities of ESCAP and report and make recommendations to the UN Economic and Social Council.The 64th session of ESCAP continues through Friday.",

The election marks Malawi's first-ever transition from one elected leader to another, and could set a precedent for other African countries facing a change in government. Malawi's first multiparty election in 1994 was praised as a model in democratic governance. Now the tiny southern African nation is striving to make this transition peaceful and orderly as well.It was a sunny day as Malawian President Bakili Muluzi made his final round on the campaign trail. The candidate of the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) is running for a third term, which critics say is unconstitutional.But the issue seems to have lost its grip on voters. Mr. Muluzi is running against his vice president, a breakaway candidate within his party, and an independent candidate.Vice President Justin Malewezi's supporters were out in force. But the atmosphere was mostly calm and relaxed as Malawians prepared to head to the polls.The voters were eager to choose a new leader, after 10 years of President Muluzi's rule.\"I think I will go for the president. I think that is where we need the change because he has done enough. For 10 years he was ruling us, and now it is time for others to take the lead,\" said one voter.And another said, \"I want a change of the president, but I want the UDF to continue governing, so I want the other person, Justin Malewezi, to take the lead.\"The electoral commission had predicted a high voter turnout and was expecting problems. But in general, analysts say, the polls ran relatively smoothly.Some delays were reported in opening polling stations, but no violence.",

The US wants them to stop fighting, but how can that be achieved if they’re not treated with respect,” he added.He said Pakistan would continue to help the US in its Afghan peace process but Washington “must change its line of action in Afghanistan.”He said Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan were good and both countries need to work together towards a shared objective.On a question, the foreign minister said Afghanistan is a land-locked country and its future economic prosperity depends on Pakistan. “It would be in Afghanistan’s interest to have good relations with Pakistan,” he said.When asked about the fate of the proposed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS), Qureshi said Pakistan would continue its bilateral relations with the US.On Saturday, Qureshi said the two-day talks between representatives of the US and the Taliban were paused after the Afghan government pulled out of the meetings.He said the Afghan government pulled out of the second round of US-Taliban talks in Doha because of an “agenda disagreement”.",

(He was not, however, sad enough to prevent the government from spending $1.8 million to purchase the items.)For the record, I don’t think these items would have sold for a billion dollars. I can see a few million at best, but let’s give Singh the benefit of the doubt and just say these items are super important and deserve $1.8 million dollars, no matter the actual value.India’s 12th five-year plan has been allocated Rs. 21.59 lakh crore ($344 billion). That’s a big number and the government will, in all likelihood, spend way more than that. Roughly 30 percent of the allocated money will go to various programs to help the poor, such as providing subsidized food grains for the rural poor. The government would do well to focus on such projects, where they can do the most good.The home minister’s comment about India being poor no more is telling. Perhaps, the country’s poverty is too ingrained and has become a part of our culture. We may not feel like it, but India is still a very poor country. Just compare it with China. China’s GDP per capita in 2012 was over $9,200, whereas India’s was $1,540. The government should focus on the country’s development—including eradicating poverty—rather than on a few personal items of Mahatma Gandhi.British Colonies, The Grapes of Wrath, and GandhiThroughout the Grapes of Wrath, there is no direct mention of India or Gandhi’s salt march but Steinbeck does talk about “British colonies” which were being freed.",

She was abducted when she was escorting Vinciguerra to a meeting with local officials in Sulu.Tarongoy and Lacaba were seized at gunpoint with Vinciguerra outside Sulu State College on the Philippine island of Jolo. The Abu Sayyaf group are said to be linked to Al-Qaida.The Abu Sayyaf, which has been linked to al-Qaida and the regional terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, is notorious for bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings. It was formed in the 1990s in the southern province of Basilan, where many militants joined following the Philippines’ first all-out offensive against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a rebel group fighting for self-rule in the Muslim-dominated south.Vinciguerra was held with Swiss colleague Andreas Notter and Filipino Mary Jean Lacaba when they were abducted by militants while on their way to a meeting at the state-run college in Patikul town.The gunmen took the three from a van, the army said, after two Swiss and an Italian staff member were freed by troops from another kidnap-for-ransom gang in southern Zamboanga Sibugay province last year.It was the second kidnapping of Swiss in the remote, predominantly Muslim region in less than a year.

Today, however, security units are needed not only for protection of a nation's coastal waters, but also for its inland waterways and highways. Terrorism and organized crime are a reality in the world we live in, and governments all over the world must provide security for their citizens.Even before September 11, the United States had the highest concentration of security and military forces anywhere in the world. The United States Coast Guard and Navy combined have more people serving than any other force. And even with the Coast Guard and Navy, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, and the FBI are only a fraction of all the forces.There are also National Guard units all across the country. And when I was at the American Embassy in New Delhi, we had our own Marine security force. All told there are many hundreds of thousands of active military personnel and over two million veterans. With the terrorist attack of September 11 and other recent terrorist activities, the United States has further increased its security forces.The United Kingdom is another major power that has been forced to increase its security forces. This increase was not just because of terrorism but also because of an increase in other criminal activity such as illegal drug and arms trafficking. The British Ministry of Defense has more than 300,000 active duty personnel and has a small army reserve. Britain's Royal Navy is one of the world's largest with around 80 warships and submarines.The Royal Air Force has more than 300 combat aircraft and almost 400 helicopters.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General William Barr appears before a Senate committee Wednesday for the first time since releasing special counsel Robert Mueller's report, as Democrats express concern that Barr is downplaying Mueller's findings to protect President Donald Trump.Barr says he will release a redacted version of the Mueller report on Thursday. He has given no indication that he will take any steps to protect the president, but Democrats have signaled that they plan to press him about his process in an appearance that is likely to feature sharp questioning.The Senate Judiciary Committee has summoned Barr to provide testimony about the findings of the special counsel investigation into Russia's attempt to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.Mueller's report found no conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and made no decision on obstruction. Since then, Barr has faced sharp criticism from Democrats for a four-page letter summarizing what he said were the report's main conclusions.",

Even fewer go to high school.Several studies of the Ghanaian education system show that one-third of students have failed to pass the national standardized test, meaning that they will be unable to pursue higher education.Poor conditions are exacerbated by corruption, as many teachers demand payment in order to pass students.Professor Laryea says that some teachers take advantage of the weak educational system to extract money from parents and students to boost their incomes. In return, the teachers do not feel the need to teach the children much.?[The] teacher will not really get out of the way and not take advantage of parents who are poor in this country to extort money from them, so that they can be allowed to pass the children in their classes,? continued Professor Laryea.?",

For months, the headlines have been filled with stories of corporate malfeasance, but now, the investigation has taken a political twist.The President's top economic advisor has quit and the leading candidate to take his place has withdrawn from consideration. Both of those men were involved in shaping or backing plans that turned out to be huge disasters for investors. And there was a new crisis for the Bush White House on Tuesday. The President's nominee for Secretary of the Air Force quit, saying he did not want to be a distraction. The nominee is a former board member of Global Crossing, a telecommunications firm that has declared bankruptcy, putting the jobs of thousands of workers in jeopardy.At the center of the scandals, the giant accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, which faces prosecution for shredding thousands of Enron documents.

Born just six years before the start of the second world war, he actually grew up during the war years, and was eventually conscripted into an anti aircraft unit, and was even held as a prisoner of war. His brother Georg however, didn't survive the war.He was eventually released from the unit, and was able to join a seminary. He was ordained as a priest in 1951, and began his career as a teacher of theology. It was in 1953 that he received his Doctorate of Sacred Theology from the Angelicum University of Rome. He later became a professor of theological dogma and history of dogma at the University of Bonn, as well as several other universities in Munster, Salzbug, Tubingen and Regensburg.He served as Archbishop in Munich for a number of years, before being nominated as a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II. A short while after that, he became the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, which was once the office of the Holy Inquisition. It is also the office that is responsible for promoting Catholicism and correcting any false doctrines.While Pope John Paul II had always been a very popular and well liked Pope, the same could not always be said of Joseph Ratzinger. As part of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, he was responsible for taking care of a wide variety of controversial topics that had sprung up during the papacy of John Paul II. These topics and issues included abortion, same sex marriage, the ordination of women and a number of other hot button issues within the Catholic faith.During the election of Pope Benedict XVI, there was a great deal of speculation and controversy as to who would ultimately become the new Pope.",

However I think that the argument in the article doesn’t go far enough. Yes indeed, the Chinese investment is in line with the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) (now PASDEP) which was drafted by the Ethiopian government. But to reduce the role of Ethiopia in this venture to the mere drafting of a developmental plan is not only incomplete but also unfair to the Ethiopian people.There are two things that need to be clarified: First, that the GTP (PASDEP) doesn’t only cover infrastructure development. It also covers the socio economic development such as healthcare, education etc. So it is not correct to say that GTP(PASDEP) is mainly concentrated on infrastructure development. Secondly it is not correct to say that the Chinese support for the growth and transformation plan is simply part of its global effort to stimulate development in Africa. China supported the Ethiopian government’s growth and transformation plan because China has a strategic interest in investing in Ethiopia: which is to open a trade route to the Arabian Sea via Ethiopia and Djibouti and on the way use the port facilities and the Ethiopian domestic market to stimulate its own economy. China sees Ethiopia’s infrastructure development as a way to facilitate its own economic growth and access to the African market. This means that the developmental agenda that you see is not only the agenda of the Ethiopian government. It is also the agenda of the Chinese government and it is Ethiopia that decided how the support will look like.",

Lee has said he may run for president in the 2008 election.The island's opposition parties, including Lee's, want to hold a referendum on the March 20 presidential election to allow voters to oust Chen midway through his second four-year term. They say Chen misused his powers in seeking re-election and want him to resign immediately.Chen was elected on a strongly pro-independence platform, and has angered Beijing by vowing to seek a new constitution and change the island's name to the Republic of Taiwan.The United States, Taiwan's closest unofficial ally, and other major powers also have expressed concern over Chen's stance, saying he should avoid moves that put the island at risk of conflict with China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.Police put the turnout at around 100,000 people, in addition to several thousand pro-independence protesters who also turned out Saturday in a largely peaceful show of force in downtown Taipei.Police used barricades to keep apart supporters of Chen and supporters of the main opposition Nationalist Party, which is allied with Lee.",

Ping was speaking at a meeting of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. The gathering brought together 45 Ministers in Africa as well as leading experts in economic planning and development.Ping said that heads of State can no longer afford to leave their ministers alone to handle the day-to-day economic development and planning activities. He argued that a greater involvement by the African heads of State is needed to speed up the integration of the continent.“It’s time for our heads of State to be involved in the formulation of this plan as no Ministers’ meeting can substitute the active involvement of the Heads of State, we need the commitment of the Heads of State if we want to move forward, as it is they who will present this plan to the African people for their approval,” said Ping.In order to address the continent’s economic challenges, Ping reiterated the need for member states to prioritize industrial development for the continent.“Africa cannot continue to rely on exports of raw materials because we lose a lot of foreign currency that would have otherwise come back to our continent as finished products. We must produce finished products from our raw materials if we are to fully exploit our resources,” said Ping.In his presentation, the AUC’s Commissioner for Economic Affairs, H.E. Dr Maxwell Mkwezalamba, told delegates that the continent’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has more than tripled over the last 10 years, driven mainly by growth in the oil and gas sector as well as other commodities.",

The complaint, the 1st in the country to name the California Catholic Conference (CCC) as a defendant, alleges that the statewide organization represents all of the bishops of California and was established to further their shared interest in avoiding scandal, bad publicity, and legal accountability.The plaintiffs are all adults who reside in Northern California, but were abused in the Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, Santa Rosa, Monterey, Fresno, Orange and San Bernardino Dioceses. Their abuse spans decades from the early 1950's to the mid-1980's.\"The sexual violence, exploitation and abuse that has occurred at the hands of Catholic Church personnel is a systemic, institution-wide and worldwide crisis,\" said Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minnesota-based attorney and lead attorney for the plaintiffs.\"The Catholic Church has knowingly engaged in a systematic effort to maintain secrecy and avoid transparency or accountability in an effort to prevent public outrage and to keep lawsuits from ever seeing the light of day in a court of law.

(Photo by Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images)One of the major themes in the election campaign ahead of Turkey’s June 24 presidential and parliamentary polls is the transformation of the country into a presidential system. But beyond all the campaigning by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in support of this, other major changes taking place have attracted less attention. Critics of the AKP government, however, are sounding alarm bells.The critics are saying that a hidden agenda is in operation to move Turkey away from its secular identity.One of the most crucial items in the agenda is a change in the national education system. In a series of changes and new regulations, the AKP government is said to be trying to open the doors of national education to sectarian imams of the religious community.In January this year, the government, without any official announcement, allowed students of religious high schools, or imam-hatips, to enter the exams to access public universities. This came after an amendment to the law on higher education allowing this, which was brought in 10 days before exams were due to start. It was also learned that there had been a change in the student admission criteria. Whereas up until 2015 candidates for access to universities could take the exam twice, from now they will be allowed to take it three times.These moves are part of a package of changes aimed at allowing the imams to enter higher education, a critic of the AKP government, Can Peker, said. Peker, who is the editor in chief of a political affairs website, Siyaset.org, wrote that “the hidden agenda of AKP on national education is becoming clearer day by day.”",

They note that the anthrax vaccine was not used widely by the military until late 1997.Many lawmakers want the Defense Department to take the lead in bioterrorism efforts.But Dr. Jonathan Tucker, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Project at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington, told the panel the Department of Health and Human Services should be given more responsibility. \"I think the Department of Health and Human Services is the lead agency.",

And empowerment comes from within, but we can empower ourselves through knowledge, skills, being confident and being prepared to work for our common goals,” she added.The Margibi lawmaker said, however, that in her personal view, the only thing that would push Liberian women forward to meet their goals is for them to start being more confident.“If we go for interviews, we always doubt ourselves, thinking we will never get the job or that the job is for someone else. This mentality has to be a thing of the past,” Senator Cooper stressed.In the country today, only a handful of female politicians currently hold elective positions, among them Senator Cooper, Bong County Representative, Virginia Sawyer, Grand Cape Mount County District Representative, A. Tombah Doe, and Maryland County Representative, Adolph Lawrence.The female politicians are in a minority in a country where political leadership positions at both national and local levels are male dominated.For example, only 15 out of the country’s 103 lawmakers are women, but Senator Cooper, the first and only female senator of Margibi County, is not discouraged by the current representation of females in the national leadership positions.“",

He was also the first Somali leader to be accepted by the United States and Europe.In August 2009, Mr. Yusuf formed a separate political group called the Somali Democratic Alliance, a rival of the administration of President Sheikh Sharif.",

(Photo: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images)The Kremlin’s recent naval confrontations with the U.S. and its widening influence in Europe amount to a “global, multipronged campaign” against America, and they’re part of a broader effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to undermine U.S. influence and assert itself, according to a new congressional study.“After Moscow annexed Crimea and sent troops to eastern Ukraine, Russia’s military provocations against the United States and Europe have returned to a level not seen since the Cold War,” the report from the U.S. Helsinki Commission, a congressional agency, reads. “Russia also challenges U.S. influence in Syria and Afghanistan, and threatens America and its allies with new and more potent weaponry.”The study, released Tuesday, comes amid heightened tension between Moscow and the West, sparked in part by Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The U.S. special counsel investigation into Russian interference, led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, has issued more than a dozen indictments—the most notable being charges against Russian trolls and hackers accused of breaking into the email system of the Democratic National Committee.The Helsinki Commission’s report states that Russia “is engaged in a sophisticated campaign to undermine democratic values and institutions” by seeking to sow confusion, and spread disinformation and propaganda through dissemination on social media, while also promoting the narrative of economic and social instability.“Russia is again acting as a destabilizing international actor.

The flooding has impacted election planning. More than 10 million voters have been registered for the October 28 presidential and parliamentary elections.Mozambique is a country in southeastern Africa bordering on the Indian Ocean. Since the civil war ended in 1992, the country has been considered a stable democracy with economic reforms being implemented by President Armando Guebuza.The main opposition party, Mozambique’s National Resistance (Renamo), has been struggling to be considered a serious contender with the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since independence. During the 1994 presidential elections, Renamo accused the Frelimo government of electoral fraud and abandoned their campaign.Renamo and the National Elections Commission have had a difficult relationship, which was evident after a visit by the leader of Renamo. Upon leaving the meeting, Renamo members were held up in the parking lot for more than an hour and a half without receiving any explanation.A week later, the Renamo party was not granted access to all documents that the commission was to provide. These documents are necessary for the planning of the campaign trail. The Renamo party’s spokesman, Fernando Mazanga, expressed his disappointment: “The fact that we were not given all the information we required is worrying. That means that we must keep a watchful eye and remain alert as the date of the election approaches.”The National Elections Commission, which was appointed by the president, is also receiving criticism from a local election observer organization, the Mozambique Election Observation Network, which stated it was “deeply concerned by the lack of communication and transparency between the commission and the various political parties.”The National Elections Commission is already preparing a new voter registry and has been receiving financial support from the United Nations Development Program.

The economic crisis is being felt across the UAE, but Dubai, a glittering playground of extravagant architectural projects, luxury hotels, mega-malls and man-made islands has been hardest hit.The UAE is comprised of seven emirates. The largest in terms of population and area is Abu Dhabi, which also has the majority of the UAE’s oil and gas reserves. Dubai is the second largest emirate, and its economy has been traditionally based on international trade and tourism. Its rulers have sought to transform Dubai into a party town in the Middle East, with beaches, night clubs and a relaxed social atmosphere. Dubai has been an extremely successful tourist destination, and in recent years has been the fastest growing emirate in the UAE. However, its economy has relied heavily on the boom in the global construction and real estate industries, and the global economic crisis that has decimated both these sectors has also had a catastrophic impact on Dubai.A report in the Gulf News today announced that the first two quarters of 2009 had witnessed 772 real estate projects in Dubai either being cancelled or placed on hold. According to the newspaper’s analysis of Dubai’s Land Department, 139 projects have been outright cancelled and an additional 633 suspended. One in seven real estate projects in Dubai have either been cancelled or put on hold. It is estimated that 85% of all Dubai’s projects worth $552 billion have been delayed. The implications of these numbers for Dubai’s economy are sobering. The cancellation and suspension of these projects will result in significant job losses. Cancelled or suspended projects are useless for the local economy and bring in no revenue from fees or services.",

This report, issued by the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) states that on average 23% of parliamentarians of the world’s 193 national parliaments have been threatened. The report however, does not state if there are any assassinations of any of these threatened MPs. Furthermore, there is no breakdown of the 193 national parliaments.In a study conducted by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the 12th Parliament was rated amongst the worst performing parliament in Africa, scoring less than 20% of effectiveness in the areas measured by the study. The 2015 study, based on the analysis of four core functions of parliament – representation, legislation, oversight, and budgeting/finance – assessed a total of 20 African countries. According to the study, there are eight indicators used for assessing the effectiveness of parliaments, and they include: The representation of different groups in parliament, the adoption of anti-corruption measures, the existence of gender parity mechanisms, oversight activities, the parliament’s legal framework and its compliance with international standards, the level of participation of opposition and minorities, parliamentary transparency, and budget execution.In a recent article titled ‘What The 7th Parliament Achieved’ (February 19, 2017), the writer wrote that ‘the seventh parliament of the fourth republic of Ghana has achieved a lot. The previous parliament was characterized by commotion and rumpus. But members of the current parliament have been able to change the tune. They are gradually rebranding the image of Ghana’s parliament as an institution worthy of respect, by being responsible and effective.’ The article, which appeared on the news website of a leading private media outlet, listed eight achievements, including an increase in the number of women MPs to a record high, an increase in the number of laws passed, and an increase in the number of bills initiated by individual MPs, among others.The following statistics, which the media outlet quoted from an annual report released by the Parliamentary Service in January this year, is instructive.",

But the government could have other children in its custody, held after being seized from the extremists.\"The government may still have some children in their custody, those they captured from Boko Haram camps,\" said one expert who has helped negotiate with the extremists. \"There could be additional releases later if they are from Boko Haram, but I think the ones they have released are the ones they had.\"",

He described the arms deal as \"transparent, legal and in the strictest respect of public morality.\"Two other defendants, businessman Pierre Falcone and his associate Arcadi Gaydamak, were convicted and handed two-year suspended sentences on Friday and fines of 300,000 and 100,000 euros respectively.Gaydamak and Falcone were convicted of conspiring to \"influence a foreign public agent\" and influence \"a person who was responsible for a public service.\"",

In an agreement announced on Friday, sushi retailer Bumble Bee Foods has promised to stop selling the imperiled bluefin tuna altogether and to purchase only sustainably-fished yellowfin, albacore, skipjack and other tunas. The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program has already given Bumble Bee the green light for its new purchasing habits, and is currently working with the company to develop its sustainable seafood plan. (You may remember that Bumble Bee was caught selling tuna that was mislabeled as \"white\" tuna back in October.)\"We believe all seafood retailers should take similar steps toward purchasing sustainable, traceable seafood for the sake of long-term industry survival, as well as the oceans,\" says Chris Lischewski, CEO of Bumble Bee. \"We encourage industry and government to follow suit. We're committed to being part of the solution.\"Bumble Bee's move, which comes just days after NOAA declared the bluefin a species of \"concern,\" sets a good example for other tuna and seafood companies, especially as overfishing, pollution and climate change threaten the world's oceans. \"Sometimes it feels like all we hear are bad things about the ocean, but today is one of those days when you can actually stand up and cheer,\" said Aquarium senior scientist Mike Sutton, director of the Seafood Watch program. So here's to the hope that the bluefin tuna can come back in style.",

The warning was raised when a meeting was held with the Afghan officials at the Torkham border. Pakistan has also rejected the allegations made by the Afghan government that it is supporting the militants who are behind the attacks that have targeted security personnel on election campaign rallies. The Afghan government had said that the security officials of Afghanistan have provided Islamabad with evidence that it is supporting the Haqqani Network. The allegations were made after the spate of bombings in Afghanistan that left scores of people killed and many injured. The attack on the campaign rally of a parliamentarian had left nearly fifty dead and scores of injured people. In response, Pakistan has rejected the allegations that it is supporting the militants in Afghanistan, while Pakistan also dismissed the claims that it is aiding groups operating in Afghanistan.Pakistan also accused Afghanistan of not living up to its responsibilities to prevent terrorism on its own soil, a matter that it had stressed at the meeting with the Afghan security officials at Torkham. Pakistan had expressed dissatisfaction regarding the steps taken by Afghanistan to secure its borders and put an end to infiltration on the Pakistani territory from its side of the border. Pakistan Army has warned Afghanistan’s NDS that if terrorist activities from across the border are not prevented, Pakistan would have to resort to other options. It would appear that such a warning and reactions from Afghanistan are a part of diplomacy, especially in view of the US decision to cut off aid to Pakistan, including its Coalition Support Funds that had totalled nearly $900 million till the last year.",

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades.

He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country.

Such problems include insufficient tests, slow results, scarcity of protective gear, the shortage of breathing machines for seriously ill patients and burned-out staffs anxious for their own safety.\"There's this sort of domino effect,\" said Ann Maxwell, an assistant inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"These challenges play off each other and exacerbate the situation. There's a cascade effect.\"The inspector general's report is based on a telephone survey of 323 hospitals around the country, from March 23-27. With hundreds of new coronavirus cases daily, the situation is becoming more dire for many the nation's 6,000 hospitals. Others can still scramble to prepare.\"Hospitals reported that their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and keeping staff safe,\" the report concluded.\"It's likely that every hospital in America is going to have to deal with this,\" Maxwell said.In most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms. Others, particularly older people and those with underlying health issues, can develop life-threatening breathing problems. The U.S. has more diagnosed cases in the global pandemic than any other country, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",

According to Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev, \"I hope we see the resumption of talks.

The Palestinians rejected Israel's offer of a partial freeze. Regev says Israel has been ready to resume peace talks all along. \"And unfortunately that's been held up until now because the Palestinian side, unfortunately, has piled on preconditions,\" Regev said.The United States has also pressured Israel for a freeze on construction in the settlements, on grounds that they are an obstacle to peace. But the U.S. has not made a settlement freeze a precondition for peace talks. To bridge the gaps, the U.S. proposed indirect talks, which will probably involve shuttle diplomacy by an American mediator between the Israeli government in Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank town of Ramallah.",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him.

But experts say growth has been stymied in the past by persistent economic imbalances, driven partially by high levels of borrowing and debt.Two senior economists briefing reporters Wednesday agreed that past policies aimed at fostering development have had mixed results.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources. She calls the conditions in CAR a level-three humanitarian disaster, the most serious that the UN seeks to address, based on the large number of victims. Cousin estimates more than 800,000 are internally displaced or have fled CAR as refugees. The WFP relief teams have provided food aid to about 300,000 in the last four months, but must now increase funding to feed at least a million needy, she says. “And the most challenging issue is that we do not have the resources to support the purchase of commodities …” says Cousin. To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence. Many were suffering from severe injuries from traumatic attacks.",

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was fined $18,000 on corruption charges, but a Jerusalem court decided that he will not serve time in prison. Olmert was convicted of breach of trust in July for helping allocate government contracts to cronies while he was minister of trade and industry. But he was acquitted of weightier charges such as accepting envelopes stuffed with cash from an American Jewish businessman. So the relatively light sentence was seen as a victory. “I walk out of here with my head held high,” Olmert told reporters at the courthouse. But State Prosecutor Eli Arbabanel, who had pushed for prison time, said breach of trust is a grave offense for a senior public servant. He said the conviction shows that no one is above the law. Olmert had denied any wrongdoing in the corruption scandal that forced him to resign four years ago. But after the sentencing he was contrite. “I accept the court's decision,” he said, “and I will learn the necessary lessons.” By avoiding prison time, Olmert is eligible to run for parliament.",

Democrats need a net total of 23 to assume the House majority, which would likely derail Republican President Donald Trump's policy agenda.The polls closed at 8 p.m. and final results were expected within hours. Voters in the state were also choosing Republican nominees to take on incumbent Governor Tom Wolf and U.S. Senator Bob Casey, both Democrats.Pennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the state Supreme Court found that the current congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans.

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks.

Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes.

At a meeting in Berlin, leaders from eight European countries called for regulating financial markets and hedge funds, investment funds that typically lead to aggressive financial strategies.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit, said all financial markets, products and participants that pose a major risk must be regulated.Ms. Merkel also called for world economies to coordinate in establishing sanctions for tax shelters and regions where financial deals are opaque.The European meeting comes ahead of a London summit on the international crisis in early April of the so-called G-20 nations, the world's top economic powers. But it is unclear whether the Europeans' call for widespread regulation will be well received by other G-20 members, which include the United States, China, Japan and several developing nations.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the European leaders had also agreed on the need to shore up international institutions like the World Bank, including in their role in helping the poorest nations.\"We decided that the international institutions should have at least $500 billion to enable them not just to deal with crises, but to enable them to be able to prevent crises,\" said Gordon Brown.",

In a speech this week in London, he warned that withdrawing aid would \"create a leadership vacuum that others will fill.\"Gates, who gives $5 billion a year to development aid through the foundation he set up with his wife, Melinda, is one of the world's most generous philanthropists. In a speech at London's Royal United Services Institute this week, he voiced fears that the political tide is turning against foreign aid.\"It concerns me that some world leaders are misinterpreting recent events as reasons to turn inward instead of seeing them for what they are: problems that although they are difficult and will take time, can be solved — if we invest in the long-term solutions that are necessary,\" Gates said.Watch: Billionaire Philanthropist Bill Gates Warns Against Cuts to Aid BudgetsThe United States remains by far the world's biggest donor, funding long-term programs and emergency relief across the globe. But President Donald Trump is proposing significant cuts to the $43-billion foreign aid budget as part of efforts to reduce government debt.Gates argues that many critics of foreign aid don't realize the major progress that has been achieved.\"If you could only pick one number to highlight the effectiveness of the development agenda since 1990, I would pick the number 122 million. That's the number of children's lives that have been saved,\" he said.He disputed the notion that funding foreign aid is a bottomless pit.\"As you bring down that childhood death rate, families choose to have less children,” he said. “The population goes down very substantially.",

Tribal leaders are able to maintain this power in part because they are often themselves government representatives and/or religious leaders.“The tribal system has been politicized and the tribes no longer cooperate with each other,” said Abdulbasit Al-Mashwali, a leader of the Yemeni Parliamentarians Union, a government watchdog group in Sana’a. “In the past they filled a humanitarian role, but not anymore.

It is her job to identify the species that are sucked into aircraft engines.\"The information we provide on species identification allows engineers to determine the weights of birds,\" Dove said. \"So when they design a new engine they take into account the weights of the bird that are ingested into these engines.\"Dove says Canadian geese weigh on average 3.6 kilograms (eight pounds), but that the average engine is designed only to withstand a bird half that size.Solution includes redesigning enginesJust as windshields have been redesigned to withstand bird impacts, Dove says engines might also need to be redesigned, though refitting them is a costly undertaking.

And of course in these times anyone who is thinking realizes that national borders have very little relevance to the global crises that are affecting us – climate crisis for one thing. It does not respect national or state or continental borders. So in this moment the most urgent and stimulating issue that’s driving my work is really the planetary crisis we’re in and how we come together as humanity to address it.Click here to hear David Byrd's interview with Shailja Patel on poetry.Some of that crisis is man-made, situations like the takeover in Crimea or the Central African Republic or the situation in Afghanistan as they are heading toward elections. Does that inspire you more than just the general situation of humanity or do you find that these things pop up and you are almost compelled to write about them.PATEL: I believe one of the most important things I do with my work is to connect the dots between what we think of as political or geopolitical conflict, and the struggle – the fundamental struggle – over resources.",

She would get up really early in the morning and get us ready for school, go to work, come home and help us with homework, then go back to work until two in the morning. So the work ethic and the sacrifice, we saw what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. She had startups in software and she'd sold them and she started new startups. So, she was your quintessential Silicon Valley entrepreneur,” says Larco.Vanessa Larco graduated with honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. She says her mother too was in computer science in the 1970s.Larco’s first job was with the technology company, Microsoft.“Microsoft was a great experience in the sense that I got an idea of how you do things at scale for a huge company. I worked on Xbox, Kinect V1 and there was hundreds of people on this project. There's a lot of discipline. There's a lot of process. And so that was a great experience,” she says.Working three years for Microsoft, Larco left the world of product management and building and delivering software which she loved to come into venture capital.

Syria, which is not party to the treaty, reportedly has been using cluster munitions since mid-2012, about one year after civil war broke out there.

She said the use of both air-dropped and ground-launched cluster munitions had increased since Russia joined Syrian military operations in 2015, but that their use had fallen off this year.\"There are several reasons for that,\" she said. \"One is that … the territory held by the opposition forces has been shrinking in the past year. Most of the cluster munition attacks have been centered on Idlib. ... A cluster munition rocket attack a couple of weeks ago in Idlib resulted in civilian casualties. And there has been use of air-dropped cluster munitions in Dhouma and in other governorates.\"The Monitor said the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in Yemen continued to use cluster munitions in 2017. But Wareham said there was little evidence that such attacks have continued this year.\"It does appear that in the case of Yemen, the stigmatization effort has had some impact,\" she said.",

The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime.

They have staged a number of demonstrations recently, some of which are turning violent.Ivorian police used tear gas to disperse one of the protests, after leaders of a student association started burning cars. The association was angry that three students were arrested Monday for taking their own security measures to control theft on a university campus.Tuesday, the same students staged a violent protest, slashing tires in front of a private high school in Abidjan where teachers have gone on strike to force the adoption of school uniforms.The teachers say they are attacked by unidentified assailants when they give out poor grades, and that only uniformed students should be allowed inside the school to prevent such incidents.Meanwhile, students displaced by the 17-month Ivorian civil war, who have been denied aid money promised to them last year, are boycotting classes this week. They say they have been living in wretched conditions, sometimes 10 to a small room, and some of them have even turned to prostitution.School protests are not unique to Ivory Coast. Student and teacher demonstrations have also taken place recently in Mauritania, Guinea, and Gabon, where schools have become what some students describe as wastelands.At the Nouakchott University in the Mauritanian capital, which has 12-thousand students, many of them from remote areas, students went on strike Tuesday.One of the organizers, Suleiman Diallo, who comes from the country's interior, says poor students need more aid money because room and transportation fees are too high.",

The Monday edition of the newspaper ran an article titled “Islam is the target,” and said that “9/11 and the latest Paris attacks are aimed at hindering people from choosing Islam.”The news outlet Akit used harsher language in criticizing France with a headline saying “they burned places, so they got burned.”‘‘The attacks happened as a result of France’s Libya airstrikes,” the newspaper wrote.The news web site Milli Gazete echoed a similar theme with a headline “Boomerang.”",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

We see international armed conflict, internal armed conflict, criminal violence, inter-communal violence, super-positioning itself in the same context,” he said.Maurer said the conflict in Syria has long ceased to be a civil war. It has become a regional crisis engulfing Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said extremism is deepening some of the conflicts being waged, leading to increasingly violent behavior.“Two-hundred thousand people have been killed since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, 9200 civilians have been killed since the beginning of this year in Iraq.

        "text": "WASHINGTON - The AP is fact-checking prepared remarks from President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech. Here's a look at some of the claims we've examined:MS-13 Trump: \"We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.\"The facts: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in a speech this week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ``and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members.'' On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ``our partners in Central America.'' That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. Opioids Trump: Changes in immigration policies, including more border security, ``will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.''The facts: Drugs being brought across borders are only part of the problem contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention, about 40 percent of the opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some are abused by the people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market. The flow of heroin into the U.S. from Mexico is a major problem, but drugs that are brought from other countries don't all come over land borders.",

The regional talks were initially expected to focus on countering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but recent turmoil in Pakistan has generated concern that Islamabad's problems are more serious. Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country. And it's not just that they are in FATA, the tribal areas. They are in our cities and that is even more dangerous.\" Pakistan has battled Taliban militants in its northwest tribal areas since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the fighting is now moving closer to population centers, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee.Professor Hoodbhoy says the government for years tried to ignore or minimize the spreading influence of the militants, without acknowledging that the situation continued to worsen. \"The present situation is where religious extremists - whether they be the Taliban or whether they be one of the very many other jihaidst groups that were early on nurtured by the Pakistan army - they are pretty much beyond control now,\" Hoodbhoy said.",

In December, international negotiators will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a new U.N. treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the climate change agreement that expires in 2012. In advance of that meeting, the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has released a new science report that underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for governments to act. The UNEP report presents scientific evidence that has emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its last report in 2007. The \"Climate Change Science Compendium\" affirms that climate change is accelerating faster than previous estimates. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner says evidence of human-generated warming is \"unequivocal\" and \"just in time for us to appreciate how the magnitude of change, the scale of change and the pace of change are in fact occurring.\"Findings from some 400 peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals and research institutes are woven into the report's chapters on earth systems, ecosystems, ice, oceans and climate management. The data show that global carbon emissions - which rose 1.1 percent from 1990 to 1999 - climbed 3.5 percent from 2000-2007. Rapid glacier-melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification will become complex problems, Steiner says, in a world whose population is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. \"And herein lies another vital message in the report,\" he says.",

Sadigov claimed that the journalist's captors planted 10,000 euros ($11,180) on him, which led to the charges. Eldar Sultanov, spokesman for the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General's Office, said the journalist was detained late on Monday \"after illegally crossing the Azerbaijani border\" with a large sum of money. Mukhtarli left Azerbaijan in 2015, around the time when several Azerbaijani journalists working for foreign or local independent media faced charges of tax evasion. Mukhtarli's wife, Leila Mustafayeva, told the AP she was waiting for her husband at home Monday evening but he never showed up.",

Afghan authorities have suggested that an attack on a luxury hotel in Kabul and attacks on electoral commission offices in recent days have been carried out by “foreign intelligence agencies.” On Sunday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry by phone, urging Washington to help the situation by putting pressure on Pakistan’s spy agency. Pakistan's advisor on foreign policy and national security, Sartaj Aziz, denied the allegations, suggesting they are part of election-season politics in Afghanistan. In an interview with VOA, Aziz said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government has tried to improve relations with Kabul. He said Pakistani authorities believed they had convinced President Karzai it has no favorites in Afghanistan and strictly adheres to a policy of non-interference. Aziz claims the diplomatic outreach succeeded in connecting with many Afghan political factions, including leaders of the former Northern Alliance, and had improved overall relations. But the latest allegations are a setback. “It is rather unfortunate because there is no justification for it. What do we get out of disrupting the elections? For us, a smooth transition in Afghanistan is absolutely critical because without peace and stability in Afghanistan Pakistan cannot be stable. So, therefore it is important that this thing is reviewed,” said Aziz, referring to the leveling of accusations.",

While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey. In comparison, less than half of those polled in 2001 backed reduced prison time. \"The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs,\" Pew researchers wrote. The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 through Feb. 23, comes as policy makers and top U.S. law enforcement officials reexamine the nation's drug policy to allow judges greater discretion in sentencing offenders, although some prosecutors have balked at the effort. The Obama administration has endorsed reducing prison sentences in federal drug cases, an idea some Republicans also endorse.

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy?

Now he is a presidential contender.The graying, spectacled man best known by his alias Timochenko launched his bid Saturday to lead the government he once battled from the jungle with a celebratory campaign kickoff featuring giant posters, colorful confetti and a catchy jingle.“I promise to lead a government that propels the birth of a new Colombia,” he said. “A government that at last represents the interests of the poor.”Breaking with the traditional campaign launch from a five-star Bogota hotel, Timochenko initiated his presidential bid from one of the city’s poorest, most crime ridden neighborhoods in a clear nod to the underprivileged class whose votes the ex-combatants are hoping to win. Hundreds gathered in the parking lot of a community center decorated with banners featuring a smiling Timochenko sporting a neatly trimmed beard, angular, thick-rimmed glasses, and a crisp blue shirt.“Timo president,” a new campaign song played from loudspeakers. “For the people.”From rebel force to political oneThe campaign is another historic step in transforming the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into a political party following the signing of a 2016 peace accord ending more than a half-century of conflict.",

While both presidential frontrunners said they were confident of victory, critics said this messy situation was part of the plan all along to keep the ruling coalition firmly in control. President Joseph Kabila has remained in power more than two years past the end of his second term mandate.Observers from the Catholic Church observation mission said the poll had been relatively calm; but, the mood in the capital was tense, and local media reported that internet access had suddenly been cut for an untold number of residents. Sunday's vote was originally supposed to take place in 2016 but postponed numerous times due to what officials termed organizational problems.The most recent delay came when a fire at a Kinshasa election depot destroyed thousands of voting machines. Then, in three districts considered opposition strongholds, the government postponed the election yet again, effectively taking a million people out of the voting process.In the rainy capital, Kinshasa, some voters said they waited more than five hours Sunday to cast ballots.\"I came to sanction Mr.",

At the Women’s Mosque of America in Los Angeles, male worshippers older than 12 are excluded, making the new Berkeley mosque the first of its kind in the country.“We uplift the female, and just as the Prophet loved women, we must follow in his footsteps and love ourselves and each other,” she said.Keeble is a 40-something convert from Christianity with a master’s degree in religious leadership from the Starr King School of Ministry, a seminary affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, which has donated space for the mosque.At Qal’bu Maryam, there is no imam, as the cleric who conducts worship at a mosque is called. Rather, female lay leaders will rotate in leading the prayers and the talks.About 50 or so women and men, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, attended the jummah or traditional Friday service, listening to prayer leader Crystal Keshawarz chant the holy Arabic words, “God is great” or “Allahu Akbar.”",
