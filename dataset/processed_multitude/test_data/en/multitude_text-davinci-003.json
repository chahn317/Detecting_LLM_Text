Secular education activists have voiced their worries that the country’s government is attempting to re-impose religious values on the education system, something that has already been attempted in the past.These concerns have been fanned by a number of recent decisions made by the ruling AKP party. This includes the appointment of government-approved imams to sit on education boards, and an alleged move by the government to establish state-funded Islamic schools in Ankara and Istanbul.The government has denied the allegations, claiming that their aim is not to take away secular education in Turkey, but to find a balance between religious and secular values in the education system. This explanation is not satisfying many critics, who point to the AKP’s track record as evidence that these decisions are part of an ongoing move to move Turkey further away from secularism.It has been argued that the move to introduce religious values into the education system runs counter to Turkey’s long history of secular education. Secular activists have argued that the changes are an attack on their beliefs, and that introducing religion into schools is an attempt to control how the population perceives the world.The debate over the government's alleged attack on secular education has become one of the most divisive issues in Turkey in recent years. It has highlighted the stark divide between those who support a secular education system and those who support a more religious one.

However, homicides, which make up a small fraction of overall crime, were up 5.2%.FBI director Christopher Wray said the reduction in crime was \"encouraging,\" but that more work needs to be done to reduce violent crime rates.\"Violent crime has been decreasing steadily since it peaked in 1991, but there is still more work to be done,\" Wray said.The annual crime report also showed decreases in property crimes, including burglaries and auto thefts, which were down 5.5% and 0.6%, respectively.However, Wray noted that property crimes are still significantly higher than the figures reported in the 1960s and 1970s. He urged citizens to continue to report any suspicious activity to their local law enforcement agencies.",

Under the deal, migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey after Sunday will be returned to Turkey if they fail to obtain asylum.In exchange, the EU has promised to resettle one Syrian refugee in a member state for each Syrian returned from Greece. The agreement also includes €3 billion to support the roughly 2.2 million Syrians already living in Turkey.In addition, the EU will lift visa restrictions for Turkish nationals as part of the agreement, provided Turkey meets certain criteria. Turkey, however, is asking for an additional €3 billion and to speed up its accession talks with the EU.The deal comes after a recent influx of migrants and refugees to Greece from the Middle East and Africa has overwhelmed the country's resources and strained its capacity to process asylum claims. It also comes at a time when the number of people fleeing from war-torn countries such as Syria is at its highest ever.The agreement has been met with both criticism and approval from EU citizens, though leaders of the 28 EU member states have expressed cautious optimism that it will help reduce the flow of migrants to Europe.",

However, after an appeal, the Jerusalem District Court decided to reduce his sentence to six months of community service and a fine of 500,000 shekels (approximately $146,000).The three judges said they felt that Olmert’s accomplishments while in office, and his \"great suffering\" since then, including his resignation as prime minister, were \"considerable factors\" in reaching their decision.The controversial decision has been met with criticism from the Israeli public and some members of the legal establishment. Prosecutor Eli Abarbanel called it a \"sad day for the justice system\".Olmert is the first Israeli prime minister to be convicted of a crime. Although he was cleared of most of the charges brought against him, the bribery charge was a first in Israel's political history.The former prime minister has vowed to appeal the court's decision, citing innocence and lack of evidence.

This has paved the way for Democrats to look to expand their gains in the upcoming elections. With the primaries, Democrats have their sights set on a number of congressional seats, both in the House and Senate.“It is expected that Pennsylvania’s primaries could be a determining factor in the control of the House of Representatives,” said political strategist Sean McCormick. “These elections will determine the political balance of power in the House and will have long-term implications for the future of the nation.”The state’s primaries will be held on April 28th and the results could shape the midterm elections in November. Analysts anticipate that Pennsylvania’s primary elections could be some of the most competitive in the country, setting the tone for the House races in the months to come. This could have a tremendous impact on the House, where Democrats only hold a slim majority. If the trend of Democratic gains continues in Pennsylvania, it could be the tipping point for a full-blown blue wave that could bring the party a stronger majority.While the outcome of the Pennsylvania primaries remains uncertain, one thing is for sure: they will be watched closely by political strategists and analysts around the nation as they could very well determine the future of the House.",

Abe's LDP won more than two thirds of the total seats in the upper house, a result which many observers say gives it a firm mandate to govern.The LDP has seen its popularity remain relatively stable over the past few months, despite some criticism of Abe for his economic policies and stalled trade deals. However, analysts say that its consistent ratings may be enough to ensure Abe is in power for the foreseeable future.Other parties have not been able to mount a significant challenge to the LDP, with the country's main opposition party, the Democratic Party, having seen its support dwindle in recent years.For his part, Abe has expressed his desire to remain in office for an extended period, saying that he wishes to stay in power in order to complete the long-term reforms he has sought to achieve.It appears that, at least for the moment, Abe is set to stay in office, with the possibility of an extended term on the horizon.",

This decrease was mirrored among students of different political orientations, with Democrats dropping from 72% to 42% and Republicans declining from 77% to 54%.Among those with the most pessimistic outlook on America's future were Hispanic and Asian students, with only 37% of the former and 40% of the latter expressing a \"very positive\" attitude. However, the survey also revealed that there were significant age-based divides, with younger students - those between the ages of 14 and 17 - being far more optimistic than their 18- and 19-year-old peers.The findings of the PRRI survey reflect the overall decline in confidence in American institutions among the population as a whole. According to an earlier survey from the Pew Research Center, only 39% of respondents expressed a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the nation’s political system.These trends indicate a pervasive sense of unease among Americans of all ages and political leanings, suggesting that the nation must work hard to rebuild confidence in its future if it wants to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized world.",

The United States National Transportation Safety Board released its final report on the incident earlier today. The plane, a small single-engine Piper PA-32, took off from a small airfield in Teterboro, New Jersey on the afternoon of March 23rd. It was headed for Dutchess County Airport in Wappingers Falls. The plane flew into a flock of Canada geese shortly after takeoff. The birds were sucked into the engine, causing it to fail, and the plane plunged into the Hudson River. All three occupants of the aircraft—the pilot and two passengers—were killed. In the NTSB’s report, the agency cited a “failure of the engine to produce power due to ingestion of multiple Canada geese.” The investigators found that the geese were “flying at a relatively low altitude,” and that the pilot had no opportunity to avoid the birds. The NTSB also noted that while the crash was “consistent with a loss of engine power,” a second factor could have contributed to the crash. That factor was “the pilot’s delayed decision to attempt a forced landing in the Hudson River.” The report marks the end of the NTSB’s investigation into the crash. The agency’s findings confirm the initial speculation of bird ingestion as the cause of the crash.",

He also pointed out that the court had repeatedly blocked investigations, including into alleged corruption in state-run institutions.Saab stated that the court should be an impartial arbiter of justice and not a political actor. He has called for the justices to recuse themselves from any investigations into political matters and to face legal sanctions if they continue to behave inappropriately.The justices have yet to respond to Saab's allegations, but the accusations come as the government is facing mounting international criticism for alleged human rights violations and its handling of the country's economic crisis.",

Following weeks of national unrest and an attempted overthrow of the president, citizens of the CAR are making their voices heard at the ballot box.The unrest began in late April, when President Faustin Archange Touadera accused his predecessor François Bozizé of attempting to overthrow the government. This caused a sudden rise in violence across the country and an influx of refugees seeking safety. Following this, the National Assembly of the CAR declared a state of emergency and Touadera appealed for help to the international community.On July 27, a presidential election was held with 26 candidates on the ballot. President Touadera was re-elected in the first round of voting, winning approximately 53 percent of the votes cast. Voting was reported to have gone off largely without a hitch, with over 25,000 ballots cast. The majority of the population were able to vote in a peaceful atmosphere.After such a tumultuous period, the election has brought a sense of hope to the citizens of the CAR. Many hope that the election will mark a new beginning for the country and that the government will continue to focus on promoting economic growth and improving the living conditions of its people. As the country turns the page on this turbulent chapter in its history, people across the Central African Republic remain cautiously optimistic for the future.",

Participants discussed recent advances in Mars science, from the first pictures of the Red Planet's core to the potential for human settlement.The panelists agreed that successful exploration of Mars is necessary in order to better understand the solar system and its potential as an abode for human civilization. They emphasized that as humans learn more about Mars, technological developments will enable us to further our understanding of the planet.Despite the challenges posed by long-distance exploration, the experts said that human exploration of Mars remains a top priority for the space community. Noting the unique nature of the challenges posed by a Martian voyage, they said that interdisciplinary approaches must be taken if humanity is to successfully settle on the Red Planet.The panelists also pointed to the potential economic and social benefits of a successful mission to Mars. With the ability to mine valuable resources, humanity could unlock a new source of economic growth.The roundtable was part of a larger effort to develop an international network of experts to discuss and exchange ideas on the future of Mars exploration.In the end, the experts concluded that the potential for exploration and settlement of Mars is huge, but the challenge of getting there remains a daunting one.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Gates warned that reducing funding for global development would have “grave consequences” on those most in need.“Reducing the flow of resources to poor countries may be seen as necessary for fiscal policy, but it would be a tragedy,\" Gates said.He cited data from the World Bank indicating that the number of people living in extreme poverty had been cut in half in the last decade. Gates credited this decline to investment in health and education through international development programs.“If these resources and the progress they’ve enabled are not sustained, many of the gains we’ve achieved will be reversed,\" Gates said.Gates called for governments to ensure that there is adequate funding for global health initiatives, agricultural research, and family planning programs. He said that the current economic climate should not deter investment in global development.\"The worst thing we could do in this moment of fiscal uncertainty is to get complacent or worse, turn a blind eye, to the suffering and obstacles we can alleviate with smart investments in development,\" he said.",

Recent comments from North Korea have suggested that the country is prepared to take on the United States in a nuclear conflict. However, analysts say that this rhetoric is more for domestic consumption and to gain leverage in negotiations with the US than a serious desire to go to war. “North Korea is a rational actor,” said David Maxwell, a retired US Army Special Forces colonel and North Korea analyst. “It understands that the consequences of using nuclear weapons would be devastating. Therefore, it is unlikely that North Korea will actually use them in a conflict.”Analysts also point to the fact that North Korea has never attacked first in a conflict before, suggesting that their current saber rattling is just posturing. “North Korea does not like to back down,” said Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “They will continue to push until they get what they want, but they have never before initiated a conflict with another country.”Experts agree that North Korea is not likely to use nuclear weapons unless they feel that their survival is threatened. Therefore, they downplay the current threats as empty rhetoric. “North Korea is simply trying to maintain its power and influence in the region,” said Maxwell.",

After years of strained ties, US officials have been vocal in their support for Taiwan's independence, while the Taiwanese government has seen an increase in access to US military technology.Analysts suggest that this is part of the Trump administration's strategy to pressure China as the two countries enter a trade war.

The new measures aim to expand income-driven repayment plans, improve the ability for borrowers to manage their debt, and reduce the burden on the nation’s college graduates.Under the new regulations, borrowers will be eligible for income-based repayment plans regardless of when their loans were originated. This would extend the plan's protections to all federal student loan borrowers. Furthermore, income-driven repayment plans will also be available to those whose student loan debt exceeds their annual incomes. Additionally, a new cap will limit the amount of money borrowers must pay each month to 10 percent of their monthly discretionary income, and any remaining debt after 20 or 25 years of repayment, depending on the loan program, will be forgiven.In a statement, Obama said that “It’s time we stopped punishing young people for doing the right thing and start rewarding those who take responsibility for their education. These new regulations will help keep college within reach for millions of Americans by making it easier to pay off their loans.”The new regulations, set to go into effect in December 2015, are seen as a victory for the many people struggling to make student loan payments and will be welcomed by millions of graduates nationwide.",

We hope that by helping to restore people's physical and mental health, we can help them to move on with their lives.\"The response from the Rwandan people has been overwhelmingly positive. Many of the survivors have expressed their gratitude for the surgery, saying that it has given them hope and helped them to rebuild their lives. The international community has also responded positively, raising more than $50,000 to fund the mission.The mission is part of a larger effort to reduce poverty and bring medical aid to the people of Rwanda. By providing reconstructive surgery to those in need, the mission is helping to restore physical and mental health to survivors of conflict.",

The ringleader of the attack, Khuram Shazad Butt, was a failed clerk and British-Pakistani. Rachid Redouane, who also died in the attack, had worked as a pastry chef in Ireland and was of Moroccan and Libyan descent. The third attacker was Italian national Youssef Zaghba, who had been living in east London.The trio drove a hired van across London Bridge on Saturday night, plowing through pedestrians in a rampage before crashing at Borough Market. Armed with hunting knives, they began attacking people, resulting in the deaths of seven people and the injuries of 48 others, some of whom are still in a critical condition.Police have yet to establish a motive for the attack, but have confirmed that all three men were part of the same terrorist cell. Several properties have been searched in connection with the attack and arrests made.The attack was the third to hit Britain this year. In March, a man drove into people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer. Four people died in that attack and many more were injured. In May, 22 people were killed and dozens injured in a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.

Thailand has reported several outbreaks of H5N6, while both Thailand and Laos have reported other strains of avian influenza. Other countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, and Nepal have also experienced outbreaks of bird flu.The spread of bird flu in these countries is concerning to many experts. Avian influenza is highly contagious and can quickly spread from poultry to humans, putting millions of lives at risk. While birds are the primary source of the disease, there is still a potential for human-to-human transmission.Health experts are urging governments in the region to take immediate action in order to contain the spread of bird flu. This includes measures such as properly disposing of poultry carcasses, eliminating contact between poultry and humans, enforcing bans on live poultry sales, and implementing public education campaigns to raise awareness of the virus.With the winter months coming, there is also a fear that the virus could spread more easily. As a result, global health experts are monitoring the situation closely in order to ensure that further spread of bird flu is limited.",

Speaking at the State Department, Tillerson said, \"The government of Cuba has failed to improve its record on human rights, leading to many of the challenges the Cuban people continue to endure. Our focus will now be holding Cuba accountable for its human rights violations and its neglect of its citizens' fundamental freedoms.\"Tillerson's comments come in stark contrast to those of the Obama administration, which had taken steps to ease the trade embargo against Cuba, while advocating for improved diplomatic relations between the two nations. The Secretary of State's rhetoric is seen as the most definitive statement yet from the Trump administration, as to its stance towards Cuban policy. Tillerson's comments also come on the heels of other efforts by the Trump administration to limit the number of Cuban immigrants, by ending the Cuban medical parole program. Tillerson did leave room for improving diplomatic ties with Cuba, however, saying, \"While the United States has acknowledged improvements made by the government of Cuba and the progress made by Cuban citizens, we must continue to press the Cuban government to allow its citizens to enjoy the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and access to information, in line with its international obligations and commitments.\" It remains to be seen just how hard the Trump administration will come down on Cuba in the coming months, but Tillerson's comments make it clear that the administration will put a premium on improving the human rights record of the country.",

The defendant was accused of aiding the arms dealer in the procurement and transport of guns and munitions.The conviction marks a significant victory for Ukrainian authorities who have been investigating the arms dealer in question since 2016. The defendant's involvement in the arms dealer's activities was first brought to light earlier this year when Ukrainian prosecutors intercepted several conversations in which the defendant discussed the business dealings of the arms dealer.The prosecution alleged that the defendant provided material support to the arms dealer, including weapons and other resources.During the trial, the defense argued that the defendant had no knowledge of the arms dealer's activities and was merely assisting him with logistical and financial matters. However, the panel of judges rejected this claim, ruling that the defendant's actions constituted sufficient criminal activity to warrant a five-year sentence.The verdict sends a strong message that those involved in the illegal arms trade will be held accountable for their actions. Ukrainian authorities are continuing their investigation into the arms dealer in question and it is expected that further convictions will follow in the near future.",

The Prime Minister responded by saying that Bulgaria supports a \"manageable and regulated\" process of immigration.

The Pope had earlier visited refugee camps and met with several migrants, including unaccompanied minors.

With the Capitol dome and the National Mall in the background, the ceremony included the traditional inaugural address from President Biden and his swearing-in by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. After being officially announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, President Biden began his speech with a solemn reminder that the country had “come to inaugurate a new administration, and a new dawn in America.” The peaceful transfer of power was also highlighted in the inaugural address, with Biden citing it as a sign of strength and hope for the country. He said, “That we are a democracy — tested, but unbroken. That we, the people, still believe in the dream of a better, stronger and more united America.”Biden then called on the country to come together, despite the deep divisions and partisan infighting of the last four years, to address the crises facing America. He spoke of the need to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, rebuild the economy, respond to the climate crisis, and move the country towards greater racial and social justice.

The plans to build the wall have been controversial, as opponents argue that it is an ineffective and expensive way to prevent illegal immigration.The Trump administration has said that it plans to appeal the ruling. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said that “the Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the decision by the court, which sets a dangerous precedent by depleting the President’s authority to defend our nation’s borders under the Congressional authority of the National Emergencies Act.”The ruling is the latest setback for the Trump administration’s plans to build the wall, which has been a cornerstone of his campaign since 2016.",

For centuries, they have relied on the river’s annual floods to help irrigate their crops. But now, the mega-dam project threatens to disrupt those vital seasonal cycles.The mega-dam, located in Ethiopia, is the largest of its kind in Africa. The project is expected to store 74 billion cubic meters of water, reducing downstream flow in Egypt by 20-25%. Egypt is the only country in the region to depend solely on the Nile River for agricultural irrigation, so the country’s farmers are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of the project.Rice farming in Egypt is already facing significant challenges, even without the disruption caused by the dam. Despite impressive growth in the industry in recent years, many farmers are finding it difficult to break even. The main culprit is a lack of access to modern irrigation systems, forcing most to rely on floodwater as their primary source of irrigation.The Nile dam project, in combination with recent droughts, has exacerbated the water crisis in Egypt. It has also made it harder for farmers to access water for their crops. Without enough water, their yields are going down and it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living.The crisis has been further exacerbated by sky-rocketing prices for basic goods. With incomes falling, many farmers have had to abandon their land and seek work in other parts of the country.The impact of the dam on Egypt’s rice farmers has been devastating, but the government is taking steps to address the issue. It has invested heavily in modern irrigation systems, as well as in developing innovative technologies to increase water efficiency.However, the situation is still precarious and it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to help Egypt’s rice farmers overcome the challenges they currently face.",

The commitment was made on Friday at the G20 Summit in Riyadh, and is intended to provide support for those countries most in need of economic assistance.The debt relief package is expected to cover the next six months and is part of a larger effort to boost the global economy by helping countries impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The IMF said it would provide “special allocation” of resources to the most vulnerable countries to help them finance health care and other priority spending, as well as protect the most vulnerable people from the economic fallout.World Bank President David Malpass described the debt relief agreement as “a lifeline to help them meet their social and health care needs, while preserving fiscal sustainability”. He added that the Bank and IMF are “working to help countries ensure that no one is left behind in the economic recovery”.The move has been widely welcomed by global leaders and advocacy groups. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described it as “an important step toward supporting the most vulnerable people and nations”, while Oxfam International praised it as “a bold move that shows what can be achieved when countries come together to support the world’s poorest and most vulnerable”.

But are his claims factually correct? Here’s a look at three of his main statements:First, Trump said that the unemployment rate among African Americans had dropped to the “lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country.” According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official unemployment rate for African Americans was 6.8% in December, the lowest since the government began tracking the data in 1972.Next, Trump claimed that the United States has “created 5.3 million jobs,” since his election in November 2016. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of jobs in the US has grown by 4.9 million since the election.Finally, the president said that the US is currently “enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in over 51 years.” That’s true; the current rate of 4.1% is the lowest since December 1969.Ultimately, while Trump’s claims can be verified, the broader context of his statements is also important. For example, while African American unemployment is currently at its lowest point since 1972, that’s still more than twice the rate of overall unemployment, and African American workers are still paid significantly less than white workers. The same goes for the president’s jobs claim: while employment has grown since 2016, the US economy has been growing steadily since 2009.It’s important to remember that numbers can only tell part of the story. President Trump’s statements in his State of the Union address may be correct in their facts, but they don’t provide the full picture.",

The report, which was commissioned by the U.S. government, claims that Russia is “significantly more assertive” than it was during the Cold War and the post-Cold War period.The RAND report claims that the Russian government is engaged in a range of activities that “appear to be part of a calculated strategy to challenge the established international order.” These activities include military force projection, cyber attacks, election interference, and other forms of hybrid warfare.The report found that the Russian government has used its military to project its influence into Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. In the Middle East, Russia has provided military assistance to the government of Syria, and is in the process of establishing a military base in the country.The report also notes that Russia has been engaged in a campaign of political interference and cyber attacks aimed at the United States and other Western democracies. These cyber attacks include the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and the attempted hack of the 2018 U.S. midterm elections.The RAND report concludes that the Russian government is “attempting to reassert itself as a global power by destabilizing countries, taking control of the regional order, and challenging the West’s established rules and norms.” It recommends that the U.S. and its allies take a “firm stance” against Russian aggression, and coordinate their efforts to counter Russia’s attempts to undermine the international order.",

Divided into hundreds of small tribal groups, Yemen is a nation of ancient tribal loyalties. Tribal identity can determine loyalties to different factions in the current civil war, with some of Yemen's population allying themselves to the Houthi rebels and others with the government. The presence of tribal forces has led to a more entrenched and violent conflict, as local groups battle for control of certain regions. This tribal system has long been present in Yemen and, in some cases, can be used to maintain a semblance of peace between rival factions. However, as the current conflict intensifies, loyalties between tribes become increasingly important and different political factions can use tribal ties to their own advantage. Consequently, this has caused further violence and disruption across the country.Yemeni leaders have proposed several approaches to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, but for the moment, the tribal system remains an obstacle to any potential peace. By understanding this unique system and its role in the ongoing conflict, international actors can be better placed to help mediate a peaceful solution.

A debate has been sparked over the rise of illiberal democracies, often referred to as 'managed democracies', across the continent.This debate is centred on the tension between those who support the traditional democratic values of free speech, human rights, and rule of law, and those who wish to pursue a more 'statist' approach to government. Supporters of the latter approach argue that it allows for greater stability and economic prosperity, while opponents claim that it undermines the rule of law and enables governments to act in an increasingly authoritarian manner.The recent surge of populist leaders and governments in countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the United Kingdom has been widely cited as evidence of this shift. In Hungary, the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has come under intense scrutiny for its attempts to dismantle checks and balances and to promote illiberal policies. Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, a series of controversial policies have been introduced by the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which critics fear could lead to a weakening of democratic values.These concerns have been echoed by the European Union, which has warned of the dangers of a 'drift towards authoritarianism' across the continent. To tackle the issue, the European Commission has called for greater respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law, and democracy.The debate over illiberal democracies is likely to remain highly contested in the years ahead. In the meantime, it is clear that a shift is underway in Europe, and the long-term implications for democracy remain to be seen.",

The board originally voted to replace the Black Lives Matter flag with a unity flag in June, in an attempt to recognize the school's diverse student body. However, the move was met with criticism from many in the community, who felt that it minimized the significance of the BLM movement.The trustees have since re-evaluated their decision and have decided to fly both flags simultaneously.",

The 5-4 decision delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts found that, when considering an individual's \"legitimate expectations of privacy,\" a warrant is required for the government to access such sensitive information.The case in question, Carpenter v. US, revolved around the conviction of Timothy Carpenter, who was accused of several armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio in 2011 and 2012. The FBI relied on evidence obtained by accessing 127 days worth of Carpenter's cellphone records, pinpointing his location and establishing his presence near the crime scenes. Carpenter argued that this amounted to an illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts agreed, stating that \"when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone...it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone’s user.\" In his dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argued that the decision was too sweeping, going beyond the Fourth Amendment's original scope. The court's ruling will likely have a huge impact on law enforcement in the US, as cellphone location records are increasingly used in criminal investigations. Technology companies, too, are likely to be affected, as some have been known to store location records for upwards of seven years. Nevertheless, the ruling establishes a precedent that places strong emphasis on protecting individual privacy in the digital age.",

The problem has become even more pressing in the past few years, and the impact has been felt throughout the educational system.A report released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has found that the number of primary school students in West Africa increased by 60 percent between 1991 and 2004. Unfortunately, this has not been matched by a similar increase in the availability of educational resources.The report also highlighted the prevalence of corruption in West African schools. Teachers often demand payments from parents in exchange for their children’s admission, and bribes are a regular occurrence. This reduces the amount of funding available for books, resources and other necessary items.The quality of education provided in West African schools has also been greatly impacted by overcrowding. Classroom sizes have swelled as the number of students has increased, making it impossible for the teachers to provide individual attention to each child.To tackle these issues, governments in the region are being encouraged to invest more in education. Increased spending could bring about much-needed improvements to the quality of schooling. It could also help reduce corruption and improve the learning environment.The report concluded that unless these issues are addressed, the lack of adequate resources will continue to plague West African schools. Without swift and decisive action, the future of education in the region is uncertain.",

With the future of Afghanistan’s governance unclear, it is uncertain how this latest political disagreement will affect the nation in the coming weeks and months.",

By ending sanctions, the US has signalled its support for President Sein's reform process and set the stage for a new era of co-operation between the two countries.

According to recent reports, an estimated 6.5 million of the country’s 69 million people are over 65, while projections estimate the elderly population could reach 14 million in the next two decades.The growing elderly population is creating difficulties in an environment that offers limited assistance for the elderly. Government welfare programs and pension programs exist, but are not widely utilized due to a lack of financial literacy and issues with accessibility. This has forced many elderly Thais to rely on family members for support, with some households resorting to taking out loans to pay for medical expenses and basic living costs.At the same time, declining birth rates in Thailand are contributing to the issue. Low fertility rates have resulted in fewer economically active people, resulting in reduced social security revenue. This has further limited the government’s ability to provide financial assistance and benefits to elderly citizens.For households already burdened with debt, the trend has been hard to cope with. The lack of government assistance and long-term economic planning has been a major cause for concern, with experts warning that the situation could worsen in the coming years if concrete steps are not taken.The growing elderly population has emerged as a major policy issue for the Thai government. To tackle the challenge, Thai authorities are exploring ways to strengthen the social safety net and develop better public and private pension systems.

The Nigerian government is now hoping that this will be followed by further negotiations with the militia in order to secure the release of other children still in their custody.",

The crisis, which began in 2014, saw the city's water supply contaminated with lead, endangering thousands of people.The OIG report noted that while the EPA has since taken steps to improve its state oversight capabilities, they remain insufficient. According to the report, the EPA has failed to hold states and local entities accountable for following Clean Water Act regulations.The OIG said the agency needs to do more to ensure the enforcement of laws like the Clean Water Act. It recommended that the EPA impose more stringent standards on state and local compliance.The report also called for additional resources to improve the EPA’s oversight of state and local environmental laws.The EPA responded to the report by saying it “will continue to strive for the highest possible standards for environmental protection.\" The agency also said it “will take the recommendations outlined in the OIG report seriously and will move swiftly to make the appropriate changes.\"The OIG’s findings come at a time when the EPA is under increasing scrutiny following the Flint water crisis.

While it is not known if any of the targets of the monitoring were involved in any illegal activity, the revelation that they were targeted for surveillance has raised concerns over the use of the Security Services' resources.Critics have expressed concerns that the Security Services are placing too much emphasis on the activities of political activists and campaigners, and not enough focus on more pressing issues, such as terrorist activity or the fight against serious and organised crime.The Security Service is yet to comment on the accusations. However, sources close to the organisation have suggested that they are taking the issue of their surveillance priorities seriously, and have opened an internal review of their operations to ensure that their resources are being used effectively.The government has also been questioned over its role in the issue, with calls for greater oversight of the Security Service and more transparency over their operations. The government is yet to respond to these calls.For now, it is yet to be seen how the issue of the Security Services' surveillance priorities will be addressed. It is clear, however, that many people are becoming increasingly concerned over the use of these powerful resources, and the lack of transparency around their operations.",

A strong majority of both Democrats (87%) and Republicans (57%) shared this sentiment.Even more notable, 53% of the participants felt strongly about the issue and agreed that “society should take action to help individuals struggling with drug use, even if it means making significant changes to current drug policies.”The report found that the public’s overwhelming preference for treatment comes from a sense of empathy rather than a lack of belief in the law. People want to see offenders get the help they need to recover rather than get locked away in prison.The findings support a growing trend among legislators in recent years to shift away from policies of incarceration for drug users and instead prioritize support and rehabilitation programs.The report further states that the American public is looking for further action from their government to invest in rehabilitation, rather than punishment, for those using drugs.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overconsumption of salt is linked to high blood pressure, a leading risk factor for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided guidance to help food processors reduce the amount of sodium in their products. They recommend replacing salt with herbs, spices, and natural flavors, as well as using a variety of salty flavors such as celery, onion, and garlic. They also suggest adding potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride to help reduce the overall amount of salt in processed food. The USDA has urged food manufacturers to set voluntary targets to reduce sodium levels in processed food, and many have already taken steps to do so. The National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) also advocates for a gradual decrease in sodium levels and works to ensure that manufacturers take part in the effort.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

During the period in between, the tiny territory has been trying to build a nation.In September 1999, East Timor was a world headline. A referendum for independence from Indonesia set off a wave of violence by anti-independence militias that left the small island territory a blackened, smoldering ruin.After two and one-half years under United Nations administration, East Timor will get its first democratically elected president in April and gain full independence in May.But the attention span of the world is short. Terrorism is today's headline, and Afghanistan is the new focus of international aid. Francis Hammond, Asia director of the International Rescue Committee, a non-governmental aid organization says the world has largely forgotten the fledgling nation just as it is about to achieve its goal.\"It's ironic that they've gone so far only to find themselves at the last hour suddenly bereft of resources to go forward. It's such a small country, and such a small population, that how much could it really cost, is always my question? And the answer is, not a lot. But the reality is, they're not even getting that,\" Mr. Hammond says.The eastern half of the island of Timor was a Portuguese colony until Indonesia - which already held West Timor - invaded East Timor in 1975 and subsequently annexed it.",

However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R. The announcement came amid public outrage after Chadian forces opened fire in Bangui's PK12 neighborhood on March 29.",

Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",

And, there have been cases of contractor abuse ranging from violence to cultural insensitivity that have given the private security industry a bad name among many Afghans.Karzai set this month as the deadline for private security firms to be replaced with the interior ministry's new Afghan Private Protection Force or APPF. That deadline has been extended for up to 90 days to facilitate the transition. But more than 50 private security companies will be dissolved and more than 10,000 security guards will be re-assigned or replaced.Brigadier General Carsten Jacobson, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, says this is an important milestone in the process of transferring all security responsibilities to Afghan forces before most international combats troops withdraw in 2014. ?The APPF is focusing now on taking over security responsibility for development projects, convoys and commercial businesses,\" said Jacobson. \"By March 2013 all security for ISAF bases and construction sites are scheduled to transition to the APPF.?Of course the service is not free. Companies and the interior ministry have for months been negotiating how the process will work and how much it will cost.",

Most have been women and children whose existence in a labyrinth of underground caves and tunnels was unknown to the fighters.In the last two weeks, many fighters appeared to be among those evacuating. But an unknown number of militants and civilians remain inside, refusing to surrender.“We are facing several difficulties regarding the operations,” SDF commander Kino Gabriel told reporters outside Baghouz on Sunday.He cited the large number of mines and explosive devices planted by IS and the existence of tunnels and hideouts beneath the ground that are being used by the militants to attack SDF forces or defend themselves.The camp is all that remains of a self-declared Islamic “caliphate” that once sprawled across large parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq.",

A preliminary session revealed differences of opinion on the best path to growth.The ministerial conference being held over the next week is based on the premise that Africa has the potential to become a pole of global growth. But experts say growth has been stymied in the past by persistent economic imbalances, driven partially by high levels of borrowing and debt.Two senior economists briefing reporters Wednesday agreed that past policies aimed at fostering development have had mixed results. Particular criticism has been leveled at what has come to be known as the Washington Consensus.The Washington Consensus is generally defined as a set of late 20th century policy prescriptions advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Those prescriptions emphasized the efficiency of private enterprise and open markets.Many African governments blame those market-oriented policies for the continent's economic stagnation in the 1970s and 80s.Last year's ministerial conference was devoted to examining the state's role in development, and this conference will hear reports based on the results of that meeting.Comments Wednesday by African Union Economic Affairs Commissioner Maxwell Mkwazelamba and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Deputy Chief Abdallah Hamdok revealed that the issue is far from settled.Hamdok argues that recent experience shows economies that have developed fastest have been those where the state has taken the dominant role.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

April was the deadliest month in the South Asian country: five grisly murders have targeted a Hindu man accused of insulting Prophet Mohammad, two gay rights activists, a university professor and a law student who criticized religious extremism on his Facebook page. The killings, often by machete-wielding assailants, began with the hacking of a blogger in 2013. Affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida have claimed responsibility for almost all the attacks, but the government says these groups have no presence in the country and points the finger at homegrown militant groups.Killings unresolved But with most of the killings unsolved, there are no clear pointers to those behind the increasingly bold attacks. Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks. Families of victims complain of slow and ineffective police investigations.A student holds a portrait of a University Professor A.F.M.

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources.

Cousin estimates more than 800,000 are internally displaced or have fled CAR as refugees. The WFP relief teams have provided food aid to about 300,000 in the last four months, but must now increase funding to feed at least a million needy, she says. “And the most challenging issue is that we do not have the resources to support the purchase of commodities …” says Cousin. To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was fined $18,000 on corruption charges, but a Jerusalem court decided that he will not serve time in prison. Olmert was convicted of breach of trust in July for helping allocate government contracts to cronies while he was minister of trade and industry.

He called on Baghdad to do the same, or face the severest consequences.The 15 - 0 U.N. vote came a short time ago at U.N. headquarters in New York.U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan says the goal is to ensure the disarmament of Iraq in compliance with U.N. resolutions.The new resolution, the subject of weeks of negotiations, allows U.N. weapons inspectors the right to search anywhere for banned weapons, including the palace compounds of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.It calls for serious consequences if Baghdad is found to not comply with U.N. demands for its disarmament. But the text does not specifically mention military action the United States has threatened against Iraq if it does not give up its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.Speaking to the Council Friday, U.S. ambassador John Negroponte said that one way or another, Iraq will be disarmed. He says if the Security Council does not act decisively against Iraqi violations of the resolution, the resolution does not constrain any member state from defending itself against the threat of Iraqi weapons.The new resolution incorporates a series of strict timelines.",

        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Despite a struggling music industry and a less-than-favorable relationship with online streaming music platforms, former Beatle Ringo Starr is still insistent on making new songs.Starr, 74, released \"Postcards From Paradise'' this week, his 18th solo studio album featuring 11 original songs by the veteran musician in collaboration with friends such as Peter Frampton and Joe Walsh. \"Even though there's very little record industry left, I like to make records because I write. I write with songwriters; I play with other good musicians,'' Starr told Reuters, noting \"because it's what I do.'' \"It's very hard for me to find a stranger these days because I've been around a long time.'' Starr has witnessed the music industry evolve dramatically over his 50-year career, and consumption is becoming increasingly digital with Apple Inc's iTunes and Amazon.com Inc as well as online streaming platforms such as Spotify and Jay Z's newly-announced Tidal. The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes. Starr himself still prefers purchasing physical copies of music. \"Streaming I don't understand anymore. All I ever hear is that your record has been streamed 17 million times and they give you a check for 12 bucks,'' he said. \"With the established musicians, that seems to be the problem. And the bigger problem with that is there's nothing coming in for the new bands.''",

Seven were killed and nearly 50 wounded. All three of the attackers were shot dead by police.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was fair to ask how the attackers \"slipped through our net.\"Security has become a key issue in the run-up to Thursday's general election. British security officials said none of the men was considered violent, but they acknowledged the difficulty of predicting whether extremists will turn dangerous. The assault was the third attack in three months in which most of the assailants had been on authorities' radar at some point.As the investigation expanded to look at how the men knew one another and whether they were part of a larger conspiracy, Pakistani intelligence authorities swooped Tuesday into the town of Jhelum, where Khurum Butt lived until the time he was 7, when he moved to Britain. His cousin, 18-year-old Bilal Dar, told The Associated Press that Butt's uncle was taken in for questioning.

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately. At the time of the shooting, the market was full of many people, including many young girls and women buying and selling produce,\" said Colville. The human rights team says the Chadian force’s action appears to have been totally disproportionate as they were shooting in a crowded market full of unarmed civilians.",

Later, General Kiyani released a statement, saying the army \"will not allow the militants to dictate terms to the government, or impose their way of life on the civil society of Pakistan.\" He also said the pause in military operations that followed a recent peace deal with the Taliban in the region is \"not a concession to the militants.\"Hundreds of paramilitary troops were deployed to Buner after Taliban militants began setting up checkpoints in the district, less than 100 kilometers from Islamabad.Peace deal includes Sharia The peace deal between the government and hard-line cleric Sufi Mohammed allows the imposition of Islamic law (Sharia) in parts of Malakand division, including Swat Valley. In exchange, militants agreed to lay down their weapons. That has not happened yet. This week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused the Pakistani government of ceding more territory to the Taliban. She described the situation as a \"mortal threat\" to the United States and the world. Taliban militants from Pakistan's Swat valley have begun leaving Buner, the district some 100 kilometers from the capital that they took over last week.",

But rights groups say this ancient system is also fueling the war and leaving the country unprepared to handle the current humanitarian crisis.“When people feel that the state is unable to protect people’s rights and property, of course they will look to their tribes for leadership,” said Hassan Mohsen, 42, a tribesman in the Khawlan village, to the east of the Yemeni capital.Tribal leaders are local rulers that often have more say in the everyday lives of average people than government officials. Tribal leaders are able to maintain this power in part because they are often themselves government representatives and/or religious leaders.“The tribal system has been politicized and the tribes no longer cooperate with each other,” said Abdulbasit Al-Mashwali, a leader of the Yemeni Parliamentarians Union, a government watchdog group in Sana’a. “In the past they filled a humanitarian role, but not anymore. Now it's all political bickering.”The tribal system was officially abandoned with the overthrow of the Imamate in 1962, but the governments that followed kept it in place unofficially, according to Abdulrahman al-Marwani, who heads the Dar Al-Salam, a human rights advocacy group in Sana'a.“For half a century governments have been handing over the nation’s wealth to the tribal leaders,” he said. “And the tribal leaders also get money from foreign sources to pressure the state’s political decisions.”Yemeni tribesmen await remains of one of their own killed in clashes, Khawlan al-Tyal, a tribal area east of Sana'a, September 2015.

The high commissioner presented a sweeping view of major human rights situations around the world in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.Bachelet said inequalities in income, opportunity, justice and the enjoyment of human rights exist in all countries — rich and poor alike. Tackling these inequalities, she says, is critical in overcoming the grievances and unrest that fuel hatred, violence and threats to peace.She cited many examples of countries where the denial of rights has led to protests and violent crackdowns by security forces. She mentioned Sudan, where people protesting harsh economic conditions and bad governance have been violently dispersed by security forces.She noted similar scenarios are playing out in many other places, including Zimbabwe, Haiti, France, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.Bachelet said she is shocked by the number of killings of human rights defenders around the world.",

All three holograms will be on display to visitors of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, west of Los Angeles, starting Thursday.They will be shown in a specially designed room that will be the first stop for guests.",

The 17-track CD is titled Lucky Dube ? The Best Of. It features all the hits that made the South African musician a household name across the continent, and abroad. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government.

Culture and Tourism Minister Ambika Soni congratulated the people of India and said the government is happy that Mahatma Gandhi's heritage \"to which we are emotionally bonded\" has been saved.An Indian businessman, Vijay Mallya, successfully bid for the items of the Indian independence leader for $1.8 million in New York after frantic efforts by the Indian government to stop the controversial auction failed. His representative says the items have been bought for India. The items include Gandhi's trademark wire-rimmed spectacles, a brass bowl and plate, worn leather sandals and a pocket watch. Gandhi is a national icon who inspired millions of Indians to join a non-violent struggle against British rule. He led an ascetic life and had few possessions.Minister Soni says the government did not want the belongings of a man who never believed in private property to be put up for sale. But she says the government cooperated with the Indian businessman to ensure their return to India when the auction went ahead. \"We wanted to prevent the commercialization which takes place, especially at a public auction,\" Soni said.",

So we need to fight, not bow out, not walk away, not give in, not give up, but fight, fight to win for Britain,\" he said.Throughout his speech, the prime minister focused on the government's achievements and portrayed Labor as the party of the working, mainstream public.On the economic crisis, Mr. Brown said his government faced tough choices on whether and to what extent the government should intervene in financial markets - to let the recession run its course or to stimulate the economy. \"We made our choice - help the small businesses, targeted tax cuts for millions [of people] and advancing our investment in roads, rail and education. That was the change we chose. And it was a change that benefits the hardworking majority and not just a privileged few,\" he said.Labor has come under vehement criticism from the opposition Conservatives for the government's bail-out of failing banks and for large public spending that many analysts say will leave future generations with a mounting public debt.But in his speech, Mr.",

Here's a look at some of the claims we've examined:MS-13 Trump: \"We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.\"The facts: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in a speech this week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ``and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members.'' On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ``our partners in Central America.'' That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. Opioids Trump: Changes in immigration policies, including more border security, ``will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.''The facts: Drugs being brought across borders are only part of the problem contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention, about 40 percent of the opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some are abused by the people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market.

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country.

They are in our cities and that is even more dangerous.\" Pakistan has battled Taliban militants in its northwest tribal areas since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the fighting is now moving closer to population centers, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee.Professor Hoodbhoy says the government for years tried to ignore or minimize the spreading influence of the militants, without acknowledging that the situation continued to worsen. \"The present situation is where religious extremists - whether they be the Taliban or whether they be one of the very many other jihaidst groups that were early on nurtured by the Pakistan army - they are pretty much beyond control now,\" Hoodbhoy said.",

        "text": "At a special United Nations summit on climate change September 22, world leaders acknowledged both the quickening pace of global warming and the world community's slow response to it. In December, international negotiators will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a new U.N. treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the climate change agreement that expires in 2012. In advance of that meeting, the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has released a new science report that underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for governments to act. The UNEP report presents scientific evidence that has emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its last report in 2007. The \"Climate Change Science Compendium\" affirms that climate change is accelerating faster than previous estimates. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner says evidence of human-generated warming is \"unequivocal\" and \"just in time for us to appreciate how the magnitude of change, the scale of change and the pace of change are in fact occurring.\"Findings from some 400 peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals and research institutes are woven into the report's chapters on earth systems, ecosystems, ice, oceans and climate management. The data show that global carbon emissions - which rose 1.1 percent from 1990 to 1999 - climbed 3.5 percent from 2000-2007. Rapid glacier-melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification will become complex problems, Steiner says, in a world whose population is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. \"And herein lies another vital message in the report,\" he says.",

It would take about six months to get the plutonium reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex running again, estimates Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the London-based IISS's non-proliferation and disarmament program. \"The danger is that if North Korea could get the small reactor going again, they could resume the plutonium production program that has been the basis of their nuclear weapons program to date,\" says Fitzpatrick. \"But we're not looking at an immediate production of plutonium.\" North Korea agreed to mothball the plutonium reactor and destroy its cooling tower as part a 2007 aid-for-disarmament deal at the now-stalled six-party talks. A spokesperson was quoted Tuesday in state media as saying work on the facility would begin immediately.A North Korean nuclear plant is seen before demolishing a cooling tower (R) in Yongbyon, in this photo taken June 27, 2008 and released by Kyodo. North Korea is to restart the mothballed Yongbyon nuclear reactor that has been closed since 2007 in a move tOnce it is up and running, it would take at least a year of restarted operations to generate enough plutonium to make one nuclear bomb, say nuclear scientists. Pyongyang is currently believed to have enough plutonium to make up to eight bombs. But it is less clear what to make of North Korea's threat to \"restart and readjust\" its uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon. Fitzpatrick says the danger is that the facility, which was first unveiled in 2010, could give Pyongyang an easier way to make nuclear weapons.",

While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey.

The council also said nursery schools should have what it calls \"values education.\"Political columnist Cengiz Aktar of the Zaman Today newspaper, who also teaches at Suleyman Sah University, said the reforms fit well with Erdogan’s objectives.\"For years, Erdogan wanted to create a new, pious youth, ethically correct according to the canons of his mind and his lecture of Islam, and he is just putting this into practice,\" Aktar said.Under Erdogan’s rule as prime minister, religious schools, known as imam hatips, have dramatically increased, from 65,000 children being enrolled in 2004 to more than one million today.The schools have 13 hours a week of religious training and strict segregation of boys and girls. In the past couple of years, many secular schools have been converted to imam hatips, in many cases with little warning to parents.\"It was a big surprise,\" one mother said.",

That comment was a response to the passage Saturday of two U.S. warships through the ocean strait separating Taiwan from China.

The United States strong military also adds to concerns among Communist officials as they grapple with ways to bring Taiwan under its flag.

Luisa Ortega Diaz said allowing the judges in the court's constitutional chamber to remain in office \"puts the nation at risk'' because of a string of rulings that have undermined attempts to challenge Maduro's government. \"It would be the death of law if we allow these magistrates to continue in that chamber,'' she said. Her move comes as Maduro appealed Tuesday to Pope Francis to take an active role encouraging the opposition to sit down for talks aimed at ending more than two months of violence that have left at least 69 people dead, including a police officer who was shot and killed Tuesday breaking up a protest in Merida state. Maduro, in a letter hand-delivered to the Vatican envoy to Caracas, accused the opposition of using minors as human shields during protests and stirring violence through social media. The letter appeared to be a response to pressure from local bishops who traveled last week to Rome to share with the Pope their criticisms of Maduro's increasing authoritarian bent.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

But for the authorities in Kiev and local politicians still loyal to Ukraine, the rapid pace of events were evidence of a carefully orchestrated campaign from Moscow. Moscow denies any role in installing Aksyonov, who is known from his business days by the nickname “The Goblin”. But even those close to the Kremlin say Russia picked him. “Moscow always bet on Yanukovich. But after the coup in Kiev on Feb. 22 ... Moscow decided it needed to back the secession of Crimea from Ukraine.",

Now, it is possible.\"When somebody calls you, your jacket vibrates and gives you lights and [you] know somebody is calling you,\" said Ivan Poupyrev, who manages the Google's Project Jacquard, a digital platform for smart clothing. Project Jacquard formed a partnership with Levi's to create the first Jacquard enabled garment in the form of Levi's Commuter Trucker Jacket. What makes the jacket \"smart\" includes washable technology, created by Google, woven into the cuff of the jacket. \"These are highly conductive fibers, which are very strong and can be used in standard denim-weaving process,\" said Poupyrev.A tap on the cuff can also provide navigation and play music when paired with a mobile phone, headphones and a small piece of removable hardware, called a snap tag, that attaches to the cuff. \"You get the most important features of the phone without taking your eyes off the road,\" said Paul Dillinger, vice president of global product innovation for Levi Strauss & Co.Smart clothing The Levi's jacket is just one step to smarter clothing. \"Do they want to make shoes? Do they want to make bags? Do they want to make trousers?\" Poupyrev explained, \"The platform [is] being designed so that this technology can be applied to any type of garment. Right now, it's Levi's but right now, we're very actively working with other partners in the apparel industry and try to help to make their products connected.\" That means designers need to be increasingly tech savvy. \"Fashion designers in the future are going to have to think about their craft differently. So, it's not just sketching and pattern making and draping and drafting.",

They had been expecting a more moderate increase.The Reserve Bank will now lend to banks at eight percent. Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao says with inflation running at more than nine percent, he has no other options. ?Inflation is expected to remain elevated for a few more months before moderating towards the later part of this year,\" says Subbarao. \"The challenge for the government and for the Reserve Bank is to ensure that demand is constrained in the short term to bring inflation down.?The surge in inflation was triggered by high food prices, which have jumped more than 10 percent in the last year and are hurting millions of poor people in the country. Hikes in fuel prices have led to a further spike in inflation. This is the 11th time that the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates since March of last year. The successive hikes have already begun dampening an economy which had been growing briskly at eight-and-a-half percent. However, the bank says there is no evidence of a sharp slowdown and expects growth to stay at eight percent.That optimism is not shared by most economists, who say that Asia?",

His father was a policeman and his mother was a homemaker. During his first 12 years, he moved five times throughout Bavaria as his father accepted various law enforcement positions.In 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Germany's Chancellor. In 1939, Ratzinger entered a seminary in Traunstein. And later that year, the World War II broke out.John Allen -- one of Ratzinger's biographers -- says soon after, he was forced to become a member of the Hitler Youth. \"In 1943, membership in the Hitler Youth became mandatory for anyone who was enrolled in a German school. So he was put on the books as a Hitler Youth member, but he never took part in it,\" says Allen. \"And in fact, he found a sympathetic teacher who allowed him to continue coming to classes, even though he didn't have his Hitler Youth card, which, in theory, all German youth were supposed to have.\"Allen says Ratzinger and his fellow seminarians were also pressed into part-time auxiliary military roles -- assigned to an anti-aircraft defense corps at a BMW munitions factory outside of Munich. He was then drafted into the army.Brennan Pursell -- another Ratzinger biographer -- says that in the waning days of the Second World War, Ratzinger deserted.",

Mr. Obama has been waiting for the election dispute to be resolved before announcing his new war strategy. As the fighting continues to rage, U.S. officials stated repeatedly the election process had to be settled before President Barack Obama could make a reasoned decision about sending additional troops and resources to Afghanistan. Administration officials say the United States needs to make sure it has a credible partner in the Afghan government before any change in strategy. Analysts say the runoff election will add credibility to the new government and Mr. Obama applauded the move. \"President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think, have shown that they have the interests of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law and an insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done,\" said the president. Election officials are scrambling to organize the new ballot as the fierce Afghan winter approaches and the country faces a growing threat from the Taliban. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel has advised President Obama on Afghan policy. \"We have got to make sure that this second round is not marred by fraud and corruption like the first round,\" he said. Riedel says U.S. and NATO troops are facing a syndicate of terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan consisting of different groups like the Taliban and al-Qaida.",

WHO director Margaret Chan said her organization will work quickly to make the products available as soon as further clinical trials show them safe and effective. However, some experts caution that further scrutiny is needed to test the microbicide's safety and effectiveness before it can be released to the public.South African researchers report women who used the gel, which contains the drug tenofovir, had a 50-percent lower infection rate after one year compared to women who were given a placebo gel. The infection rate was 39 percent lower after two-and-a-half years.In a joint statement, WHO and UNAIDS said they will gather experts next month to discuss the next steps for the research. The meeting will include advocates in women's health, HIV prevention, microbicide research and public health.",
