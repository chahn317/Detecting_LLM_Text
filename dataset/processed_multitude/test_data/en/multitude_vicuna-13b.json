The controversial move comes amid growing tensions between the government and opposition parties, who have accused the ruling party of attempting to rig the vote.Speaking at a press conference, Barandagiye argued that the media should not be allowed to cover the elections, as it could \"compromise the transparency of the vote.\" He stated that the media has a \"negative impact\" on the country's political process, and that it was necessary to \"protect the integrity of the election.\"However, opposition parties have accused the ruling party of trying to suppress their message and restrict press freedom. \"This is a clear attempt by the ruling party to silence opposition voices and limit the ability of the media to report on the election,\" said one opposition leader. \"The media is essential to a fair and democratic process, and any attempt to restrict it is unacceptable.\"Human rights groups have also condemned the move, with Amnesty International calling it \"a blatant attack on press freedom.\" The organization's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, said that \"the media plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable and ensuring that the voices of all Burundians are heard.\"It remains to be seen how the government will respond to Barandagiye's call, but the move has already sparked widespread condemnation from both local and international actors.",

However, challenges to the results have been filed by Poroshenko's campaign and another opposition candidate, Yulia Tymoshenko, who finished third in the race.Tymoshenko's campaign alleges that the vote was rigged in favor of Zelensky and has called for a recount. Meanwhile, Poroshenko's team has accused the election commission of misconduct, including the use of fake documents and pressure on voters.The election commission has denied any wrongdoing and has said it will investigate the allegations. The international community has called for calm and urged all parties to respect the results of the election.The developments come amid heightened tensions between Ukraine and its Russian-backed separatist territories in the east, as well as between Ukraine and Russia itself. Zelensky has promised to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but the dispute over the election results could further complicate efforts to stabilize the country.",

Despite being rescued by police in 2012, she suffered from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.In a recent ruling, the woman was awarded $340,000 in compensation by the New South Wales government, in a landmark decision that acknowledges the trauma and suffering of victims of trafficking.This is the first time that the government has provided compensation to a victim of trafficking in Australia. It is hoped that this decision will encourage other victims to come forward and seek justice.The case highlights the prevalence of sex trafficking in Australia and the urgent need for stricter laws and harsher penalties for traffickers. The government must do more to protect vulnerable individuals and prosecute those who engage in this heinous crime.It is also important to raise awareness of the dangers of sex trafficking and to support organizations that provide assistance to victims. By working together, we can help put an end to this exploitative practice.",

The report found that Native American women are more likely to be victims of crime than any other group in the United States.Experts say that the high rates of crime against Native American women can be attributed to a number of factors, including historical trauma, poverty, and lack of access to resources. Additionally, the geographic isolation of many Native American communities can make it difficult for law enforcement to respond to incidents of crime.The report also found that Native American women are disproportionately affected by violence committed by intimate partners. According to the report, 87% of Native American women who experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking reported that the perpetrator was a current or former intimate partner.In response to the report, the Department of Justice has announced a number of reforms aimed at addressing the issue. These reforms include increased funding for tribal law enforcement agencies and expanded access to victim services.However, some advocates say that more needs to be done to address the high rates of crime against Native American women. They are calling for increased funding for community-based programs that focus on prevention and intervention, as well as increased support for tribal courts and legal systems.Native American women are a vital part of the fabric of our nation, and it is essential that their rights and safety be protected. The high rates of crime against Native American women are a pressing issue that must be addressed, and it is my hope that the reforms announced by the Department of Justice will lead to a safer and more just society for all.",

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is expected to provide clean energy to millions of people in Ethiopia and Sudan, but its construction has caused ripples of concern in Egypt.Farmers in Egypt's Nile Delta, who rely heavily on the river's water to irrigate their crops, are worried that the dam will disrupt the delicate balance of the region's water resources. The GERD will not only regulate the flow of the Nile, but also generate power by using the water's energy. This could reduce the amount of water that reaches Egypt, which could have a severe impact on the country's agriculture industry.According to reports from the United Nations, Egypt's irrigated agriculture sector employs over one million people and contributes significantly to the country's economy. The government has already expressed concerns about the dam's potential impact on the country's water resources and has called for negotiations to reach a \"fair and balanced\" agreement with Ethiopia.However, the situation could be further complicated by the tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia over the dam. Ethiopia began constructing the dam in 2011, and Egypt has expressed concerns over the dam's potential to disrupt the Nile's flow and affect its water supply.Rice farmers in Egypt's Nile Delta are already facing challenges due to rising water prices, salination, and pollution. The GERD will only add to their struggles, and they are calling on the government to take action to protect their livelihoods.The GERD is expected to be completed in the next few years, and many believe that its impact on Egypt's agriculture industry will be severe.",

These countries, while democratically elected, are seen as failing to uphold the basic tenets of liberal democracy such as the rule of law, the protection of minority rights and the independence of the judiciary.Hungary and Poland are often cited as examples of countries that are moving in this direction. In Hungary, the government has been accused of eroding the independence of the judiciary and media, while Poland has seen a clash between the government and the judiciary over the constitutional court.Critics argue that this trend is a threat not only to the democratic principles of the European Union but also to the stability and prosperity of the entire region. They point to the fact that these countries are key members of the EU and their actions can have a significant impact on the bloc as a whole.However, not everyone is convinced that this is a cause for concern. Some argue that these countries are simply charting a different path towards democracy, one that does not necessarily align with the norms and values of Western Europe.Whether or not this trend represents a real threat to the democratic order in Europe remains to be seen. But what is clear is that the rise of illiberal democracies is a development that cannot be ignored. It is a challenge that policymakers, civil society and the wider public must all take seriously as they seek to shape the future of the region.Word-processing note: The text has been proofread and spell-checked.",

The elections will be held in a peaceful and stable environment, following the signing of a landmark peace accord between the ruling Frelimo party and the opposition in 2019.The agreement ended a 15-year insurgency by opposition group Renamo, which had threatened to derail the country's progress towards stability and economic growth.The main contenders in the elections are the ruling Frelimo party, led by President Filipe Nyusi, and the opposition Democratic Republic of Mozambique (DRM), led by Opposition leader Salvador Namburete.The Frelimo party has been in power since independence, and has overseen significant economic growth and development in Mozambique. However, the opposition accuses the ruling party of widespread corruption and abuse of power.The opposition DRM, on the other hand, has promised to clean up government and ensure that the country's natural resources are used for the benefit of all Mozambicans.The race is tight, and the outcome of the elections remains uncertain. It is expected that the results will be known by the end of the day on October 15.The elections will be closely watched by the international community, which has a significant stake in the stability and prosperity of Mozambique. The country is home to major natural gas and coal deposits, and is an important gateway to other markets in southern Africa.Mozambique has made significant progress in recent years, with strong economic growth, improved infrastructure, and expanding access to education and healthcare.",

He has often been the swing vote in closely divided cases, and his departure will leave the court with a vacancy that will likely be filled by a more conservative justice.Kennedy's retirement has been rumored for some time, and he will leave the court at the age of 81. He has been a member of the court for over 30 years and has played a significant role in shaping American jurisprudence during that time.The announcement of Kennedy's retirement has already sparked a political firestorm, with both Democrats and Republicans jockeying for position to influence the nomination process. President Trump has already indicated that he plans to nominate a candidate from a list of 25 potential nominees that he released during the 2016 campaign.Kennedy's departure will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the direction of the court, which has been divided along partisan lines on many key issues in recent years. With Kennedy's retirement, the court will have a more conservative tilt, and many observers expect that the court will take a more restrictive view on issues such as abortion, campaign finance, and environmental regulation.The nomination process for Kennedy's successor is certain to be contentious, with Democrats seeking to block any nominee who they believe will tilt the court too far to the right.",

The President claimed that the economy is the best it has ever been. While the economy has been strong in recent years, it is not the best it has ever been. In fact, there have been several periods in American history when the economy has performed better, such as in the 1960s.2. Trump also claimed that his administration has created 7 million jobs. While it is true that the economy has added jobs during Trump's presidency, the President's number is an exaggeration. The actual number of jobs created is closer to 2 million.3. The President also claimed that he has cut regulations more than any other President in history. While it is true that the Trump Administration has rolled back many regulations, this claim is not supported by data. In fact, the Obama Administration was the most active in terms of creating regulations, while the Trump Administration has actually increased the number of regulations.4. Trump also claimed that his administration has achieved the \"greatest progress in the history of our country\" in terms of addressing the opioid crisis. While it is true that the Administration has taken some steps to address the crisis, this claim is misleading. In reality, the opioid crisis continues to be a major problem in the United States and has not been effectively addressed.5. Finally, the President claimed that his Administration has \"started the construction of a wall on the southern border\". While it is true that some construction of the wall has taken place, the claim that it has been \"started\" is misleading. The wall remains incomplete and many parts of it have yet to be built.In conclusion, while the President made some accurate statements in his State of the Union address, he also made several exaggerated or misleading claims.

According to sources close to the military, the US has been stepping up its efforts to disrupt the Taliban's ability to communicate and coordinate their attacks.The raid, which took place in the southern province of Kandahar, targeted a key command and control center for the Taliban. Officials say that the center was used to plan and coordinate attacks on coalition forces and Afghan civilians.The operation was carried out by US Special Forces, who worked with Afghan commandos to destroy the facility. The raid was a significant success, according to military sources, who say that it has dealt a serious blow to the Taliban's ability to communicate and coordinate their operations.The raid is being seen as a sign of the US's increasing frustration with the Taliban's continued resistance. With peace talks between the two sides stalled, the US seems to be taking a more aggressive approach to dealing with the Taliban.The raid also underscores the challenges facing US forces in Afghanistan. The country remains a dangerous and unpredictable place, and the Taliban continues to pose a significant threat to coalition forces and Afghan civilians.In a statement, coalition forces said that they would continue to work with the Afghan government to 'degrade the Taliban's ability to harm the Afghan people and prevent them from plotting attacks against the US and its allies.'The US tactics in Afghanistan are expected to remain a key focus of attention in the coming weeks and months, as the US and its allies continue to fight against the Taliban and other militant groups in the country.",

This decision was taken by the government of Cameroon after intelligence reports suggested that the extremist group was planning to target schools in the region.The schools that have been closed are primarily located in the Far North region of Cameroon, which has been severely affected by the Boko Haram insurgency in recent years. The government has stated that the decision to close the schools was taken to prevent any further loss of lives and ensure the safety of students and teachers.The move has, however, been criticized by some who argue that closing schools will not solve the problem and that it will only lead to the deprivation of education for thousands of students. They argue that the government should instead invest more in security measures to protect schools and ensure the safety of students and teachers.The Boko Haram insurgency has been ongoing in Nigeria and neighboring countries, including Cameroon, for several years. The group has been responsible for a number of attacks on schools, leading to the death of many students and teachers. The Cameroonian government has been under pressure to take action to protect its citizens and prevent further attacks.The closure of schools in Cameroon is the latest in a series of measures taken by the government to combat the Boko Haram threat. Earlier this year, the government also announced the deployment of additional troops to the region to boost security.While the decision to close schools may be intended to protect students and teachers, it remains to be seen whether it will be effective in preventing further attacks by Boko Haram. The government must work to ensure that the security measures put in place are sufficient to protect schools and prevent any further loss of lives.",

However, social media's role in times of tragedy is not without its controversies.On one hand, social media has been instrumental in facilitating communication, mobilizing support, and raising awareness about important issues. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have been used by activists, NGOs, and ordinary citizens to share information, coordinate relief efforts, and amplify the voices of those affected by disasters.For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was utilized to disseminate accurate information and debunk false rumors, enabling people to make informed decisions about their health and wellbeing. Social media has also been used to connect people who are physically isolated, providing a sense of community and solidarity during a time of great uncertainty.On the other hand, social media has also been a source of confusion, misinformation, and hate speech, exacerbating the suffering of those affected by disasters. In times of crisis, false news and rumors can spread like wildfire, causing panic and undermining the efforts of relief organizations. Social media has also been used to spread hate speech, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to a climate of fear and mistrust.The role of social media in times of tragedy highlights the need for responsible reporting, digital literacy, and media literacy. It is essential that social media users take a critical approach to the information they consume and share, verifying sources and checking facts to prevent the spread of misinformation.Moreover, media organizations and journalists have an obligation to report responsibly and adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring that their coverage is accurate, balanced, and respectful of those affected by disasters.",

The survey, which was conducted on a representative sample of over 4,000 US adults, found that 62% of respondents felt that drug users should receive treatment, while only 33% believed that they should be arrested and punished.The survey also found that there was a significant partisan divide on the issue, with 73% of Democrats believing that drug users should receive treatment, compared to 51% of Republicans. However, there was also a majority of Independents who supported treatment over jail time, with 59% agreeing with this view.The findings of the survey are in line with a growing movement towards treating drug addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue. Many experts argue that punitive approaches to drug use, such as imprisonment, are ineffective in addressing the root causes of addiction and often lead to further harm to individuals and communities.Instead, many advocate for a harm reduction approach that focuses on providing access to social and medical services, such as counseling, therapy, and clean needles, to help individuals overcome their addiction. This approach is supported by evidence from countries that have implemented such policies, which have seen a reduction in drug-related crime and an improvement in public health outcomes.In response to the survey findings, some experts have called on policymakers to prioritize investments in drug treatment and prevention programs, rather than relying on punitive measures to address drug use. They argue that this approach would not only benefit individuals struggling with addiction, but also contribute to safer and healthier communities overall.In conclusion, the Pew Research Center's survey results reflect a growing recognition of the need to address drug addiction as a health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue.",

The move comes less than a month after the central bank lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy.The RBI has raised the short-term lending rate, known as the repo rate, by 25 basis points to 6.75%. The move is aimed at bringing down inflation, which has been stubbornly high despite the central bank's efforts to cool it down.This is the second time in six months that the RBI has changed its stance on interest rates. In October, it lowered interest rates by 40 basis points to boost growth.

The men, who were all Muslim, were found guilty of planning to carry out a series of bomb attacks on British targets.The men, who ranged in age from their mid-20s to early 40s, were arrested in a series of raids across the UK in 2011. They were charged with conspiring to commit acts of terrorism, including planting bombs on London's transport system.The court heard that the men had been radicalized by Islamic teachings and had been planning the attacks for several years. The judge said that the men's actions were \"barbaric and cruel\" and that they had shown no remorse for their actions.The sentence has been welcomed by many in the UK, who say that it sends a clear message that terrorism will not be tolerated. Others, however, have criticized the sentence, saying that it is too harsh and that it could fuel further resentment among the Muslim community.Overall, the case highlights the ongoing challenge of combating terrorism in the UK and beyond. While the sentence may provide some measure of justice for the victims, it is clear that much more needs to be done to prevent young people from being radicalized and to counter the ideology of terrorism.",

The children, who were between the ages of 8 and 18, were recruited into the armed groups mainly due to poverty and lack of education.The release of the child soldiers was made possible through the efforts of various organizations and government bodies, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), and the government of South Sudan.According to UNICEF, the released children will be provided with psychological and medical support, as well as education and vocational training to help them reintegrate into their communities.South Sudan has been embroiled in conflict since December 2013, leading to the displacement of millions of people and a significant rise in the number of child soldiers. The release of these child soldiers is seen as a positive step towards peace and stability in the young nation.In a statement, UNICEF Representative in South Sudan, Hamid El-Bashir, expressed his appreciation for the government's efforts in releasing the child soldiers and called for continued efforts to end the recruitment of children by armed groups.\"We hope that this will be a first step in a sustained effort to end the use of children by armed groups in South Sudan,\" El-Bashir said. \"The release of these children is a critical step towards ensuring their safety and well-being, and we urge all armed groups to follow suit.\"The release of the child soldiers comes at a time when the government of South Sudan and various armed groups are engaged in peace talks aimed at ending the conflict.",

The country has been criticized for its handling of the migration crisis, with rights groups accusing authorities of mistreating migrants and failing to provide adequate housing and other assistance.In his speech, the Pope also called for greater respect for the rights of migrants and refugees, and urged authorities to do more to help them integrate into society.\"Migrants and refugees are not a threat to our society,\" he said. \"They are a challenge to our solidarity, our openness and our hospitality.\"The Pope's message was particularly significant given the recent election of a right-wing government in Bulgaria, which has pledged to crack down on migration.\"",

The killings have been carried out by suspected Islamist militants, and they have left many people feeling anxious and insecure.The victims include secular bloggers, academics, and foreigners, highlighting the danger of violence and intolerance in a country that has long been known for its moderate and tolerant form of Islam.Bangladesh has a history of secularism and religious diversity, but in recent years there has been a rise in conservative Islamist ideology, which has led to increased violence and harassment of minority groups.The government of Bangladesh has been criticized for its slow response to the violence and its inability to bring the perpetrators to justice. Many fear that the lack of action will only embolden the extremists and lead to further violence.The international community has also been critical of Bangladesh's handling of the situation, with some countries expressing concern about the safety of their citizens in the country.The recent killings are a stark reminder of the challenges facing Bangladesh as it tries to balance its secular traditions with the demands of conservative religious groups. It is important for the government and people of Bangladesh to stand up for their secular values and protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of their religious or ethnic background.",

The cause of the crash is yet to be determined, and an investigation has been launched.Skripal was known for her vast business empire, which included stakes in some of Russia's biggest companies. She was also actively involved in philanthropy, and had donated large sums of money to charitable causes.Born in Moscow, Skripal had a successful career in finance before turning to business.

The decision has been met with condemnation from Palestinian leaders, who have accused Israel of trying to change the demographic make-up of East Jerusalem.The construction of new homes in East Jerusalem is a sensitive issue, as the area is considered to be occupied territory by many countries, including the United States and the European Union. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War and has since settled hundreds of thousands of Jews in the area, effectively creating a majority Jewish population.Palestinians, however, view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and have fiercely opposed Israeli settlement expansion in the area. The international community, meanwhile, has long called on Israel to halt settlement construction, arguing that it undermines the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Israeli government's approval of the new homes in Ramot comes just a week after US President Donald Trump unveiled his much-anticipated \"Deal of the Century\" peace plan, which heavily favors Israel and effectively gives it carte blanche to annex large swathes of the West Bank.The Palestinian leadership has already rejected the plan, while many Arab leaders have denounced it as a gross violation of international law. With tensions running high in the region, the Israeli government's latest decision to approve new homes in East Jerusalem is unlikely to do anything to ease the situation.",

It was a move that was widely criticized by the international community and resulted in significant economic sanctions being imposed on Russia. The situation in Crimea remains tense to this day, with Ukrainian forces continuing to resist Russian occupation.In light of recent events, it is important to examine how the annexation of Crimea was able to take place. The answer lies in the actions of the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine, who played a crucial role in delivering Crimea to Moscow.The separatist movement in eastern Ukraine began in 2014, with pro-Russian activists taking control of key buildings in the region. This was followed by the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, which was largely seen as a response to the events in eastern Ukraine. The separatist movement in eastern Ukraine provided the perfect pretext for Russia to intervene in Ukraine and claim Crimea as its own.The Russian government has always maintained that the annexation of Crimea was a necessary step to protect the rights of ethnic Russians in the region. However, this claim has been widely discredited by the international community, who view the annexation as a violation of international law.Despite this, the Russian government continues to maintain its hold on Crimea, and the situation remains tense. The Ukrainian military continues to resist Russian occupation, and tensions between the two countries continue to escalate.In conclusion, the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 was made possible by the actions of the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. The events of 2014 continue to have a significant impact on international relations, and the situation in Crimea remains a major source of tension between Russia and Ukraine.",

The presidential election is being hailed as a critical step towards stability and reconciliation in the troubled nation, which has faced repeated bouts of unrest and conflict since its independence from France in 1960.Sunday's vote marks the first time that the CAR's citizens will have the opportunity to elect their president through a democratic process. The last time the country had a presidential election, in 2016, it was marred by violence and allegations of fraud, which led to the ousting of then-President Francois Bozize.This time around, there are 14 candidates vying for the top job, including two former prime ministers and a former rebel leader. The leading contenders, however, are former health minister Abdoula Souaré, who is running as an independent, and Félix Touadéra, a former prime minister who is representing the Union pour la Republique (UPR) party.Souaré has been endorsed by the ruling party, but has also managed to gain support from several opposition groups. Touadéra, on the other hand, has the backing of the UPR, which is the largest opposition party in the country.The election is being overseen by the United Nations, which has deployed some 1,200 peacekeepers to support the electoral process. There are also some 10,000 soldiers from the African Union and the French army providing security in the capital, Bangui.The international community is closely watching the vote, which is seen as a crucial test of the country's ability to move beyond its troubled past and embark on a path towards peace and stability.",

According to the Commerce Department, retail sales declined 0.2% last month, falling short of the expected 0.3% increase. This marks the second straight month of weak sales, as May's retail sales were revised down to a 0.1% increase from a previously estimated 0.3% growth.The disappointing sales data have added to the growing list of concerns about the economy, which has already been facing challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruptions to global supply chains. The weak retail sales come as the Federal Reserve has been signaling its intention to cut interest rates later this year to boost economic growth. However, the slowdown in consumer spending may complicate the central bank's efforts to revive growth.Retail sales are a key indicator of consumer confidence and spending, which make up a significant part of economic activity. A sustained period of weak sales could put pressure on companies' earnings and lead to layoffs, further dampening consumer sentiment and the broader economy.The Commerce Department also reported that automobile sales, which are a key component of retail sales, declined 1.3% in June, the fourth straight month of decreases. Other sectors that saw declines in sales last month include building materials, gasoline stations, and clothing stores. On the other hand, spending on electronics and appliances increased, as did spending on health and personal care products.The latest retail sales data suggest that the economic recovery is still fragile and that the road ahead could be bumpy. As such, policymakers and businesses will need to remain vigilant and take steps to mitigate the risks to the economic outlook.",

The move is aimed at reducing the nation's salt intake, which is linked to a number of health problems, including high blood pressure and heart disease.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a target of reducing the average amount of salt consumed per day from 3,400 milligrams to 2,600 milligrams by 2025. The agency believes that this reduction is achievable and will have a significant impact on public health.According to the FDA, excessive salt consumption is a major contributor to the high rates of hypertension in the US. The agency estimates that reducing salt intake by 30% could prevent millions of cases of hypertension and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs.In response to the government's call to action, many food manufacturers have already begun reducing the amount of salt in their products. Some have developed low-sodium versions of popular foods, while others have reformulated their products to use alternative seasonings and flavorings.However, the FDA acknowledges that some foods are naturally high in salt and may require special processing or ingredient substitutions to reduce salt content. The agency is working with industry stakeholders to develop voluntary sodium reduction targets for these products.Despite the challenges, public health experts are hailing the government's initiative as a major step towards improving public health. The American Heart Association has praised the FDA for taking \"bold action\" to address the nation's salt consumption, and has called on other countries to follow the US's lead.In conclusion, the US government's call to action is a significant step towards reducing the country's salt intake and improving public health.",

The report also found that Germanwings, the airline involved in the crash, failed to detect Lubitz's problems despite having access to his medical records.In light of these findings, the BEA has recommended that airlines and regulatory authorities take steps to improve the monitoring and evaluation of pilots' mental and physical health. This includes regular medical checks, mental health screenings, and the creation of a European-wide database of pilots' medical records, which can be accessed by airlines and regulators.The recommendations have been welcomed by the aviation industry and regulatory authorities, who have agreed to work together to implement the necessary measures to improve the safety of air travel. However, some have questioned whether the proposed measures will be sufficient to prevent similar tragedies in the future.The Germanwings crash was a tragedy that shocked the world, and it is clear that steps must be taken to ensure that such a disaster never happens again.

The tribal system, which has been a fundamental part of Yemeni society for centuries, is now contributing to the deepening conflict in the country.Yemen is divided into various tribal confederations, each with its own traditions, customs, and laws. These tribes have long maintained their own autonomous governance, which has led to a lack of centralized authority and government control over certain regions of the country.The current conflict in Yemen has further exacerbated the divisions between the different tribes. The conflict began in 2015, when the Houthi rebellion, backed by Iran, took control of much of the country, including the capital, Sana'a. Since then, the country has been divided between the government forces, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and the Houthi rebels.The conflict has created a power vacuum in many parts of the country, which has been filled by tribal leaders. These leaders have used their influence and power to further their own interests, often at the expense of the broader population. The lack of a strong central government has only strengthened the position of these tribal leaders, and has made it more difficult for the government to maintain control.The tribal system has also made it more difficult for humanitarian organizations to operate in the country. Humanitarian workers have been subject to kidnapping and other forms of violence, and many of the areas they need to access are controlled by tribal leaders who may not be sympathetic to their cause.The situation in Yemen is complex and multifaceted, but the tribal system is undoubtedly a contributing factor to the deepening conflict. The international community has been working to bring an end to the conflict, but it will likely require a long-term solution that addresses the underlying issues of tribalism and governance in Yemen.",

The move, which is part of a broader strategy to normalize relations with the government of CAR, could lead to a power vacuum that could be filled by armed groups, analysts say.Chad's military intervention in CAR began in 2013, when it deployed soldiers to help the government fight rebels. The move was widely seen as an attempt to secure mining and oil contracts in the country. The withdrawal of Chadian forces could weaken the government's ability to maintain control over the country, particularly in the regions where Chadian troops have been stationed.The withdrawal of Chadian troops could also have wider implications for the region. The Central African Republic has been plagued by instability since a coup in 2013, and a power vacuum could lead to further violence and destabilization. The country is already home to several armed groups, including the Seleka coalition and the anti-Balaka movement, which have been responsible for widespread violence and human rights abuses.Analysts say that the withdrawal of Chadian troops could embolden these groups, which could seek to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawal. This could further complicate the already challenging peacekeeping efforts in the country, as the government and its international partners struggle to maintain stability in the face of widespread violence and insecurity.Overall, the withdrawal of Chadian troops from the Central African Republic raises concerns about the stability of the country and the wider region. While the move could lead to a normalization of relations between Chad and the CAR government, it could also create a power vacuum that could be filled by armed groups and further destabilize the country. The international community must work closely with the government and its partners to ensure that the withdrawal of Chadian troops does not lead to further violence and instability in the region.",

It has also urged China to engage in dialogue with Taiwan instead of using military threats.The situation has put the United States and China on a collision course, with the world's two largest economies squaring off over a range of issues, from trade to technology.Experts say that the current situation is the most tense between China and the United States since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. They warn that any conflict between the two countries would have significant consequences for the global economy and the stability of the region.The United States has been seeking to strengthen its alliances in the region in recent years, particularly with Japan and South Korea, which also have territorial disputes with China.Taiwan, which has been self-governing since 1949, has never renounced its claim to sovereignty over China.",

It was the colt's first graded stakes win and pushed his career earnings over $1.1 million.Exaggerator broke well from the gate and dueled with eventual third-place finisher, Cherry Wine, through an opening quarter in 22.18 seconds and a half-mile in 45.29 seconds.Nyquist, who broke last in the field of 10, advanced steadily through the early stages of the race, moving into second place by the time the horses reached the final turn.In the stretch, it was a two-horse race between Exaggerator and Nyquist, with Exaggerator showing a strong finishing kick to secure the win.Exaggerator's victory marked the fifth straight year that the Preakness has been won by a different horse than the Kentucky Derby, with Exaggerator's time equaling that of the winning time of last year's race.Desormeaux, who celebrated his fourth Preakness win, said, \"This horse was amazing. I was just along for the ride.\"Keith Desormeaux added, \"To win a race like the Preakness is incredible. I'm at a loss for words.\"",

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

A referendum for independence from Indonesia set off a wave of violence by anti-independence militias that left the small island territory a blackened, smoldering ruin.After two and one-half years under United Nations administration, East Timor will get its first democratically elected president in April and gain full independence in May.But the attention span of the world is short.

However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R.

VOA's Jim Stevenson was at the game in Hangzhou, where the defending champions seemed to struggle at times, despite playing a relatively weaker opponent.Germany opened the scoring in Hangzhou's Dragon Stadium with a 21st minute strike from captain Birgit Prinz. The score was the 13th career goal for Prinz in a Women's World Cup game, making her the all-time scorer at the event. Her first goal came in the 1995 tournament.The German women ran past the Japanese defenders for most of the game, but came up short on several scoring opportunities. Prinz told VOA sports that fact bothers her, and makes her record somewhat meaningless.\"Honestly, after the game it is not so important for me. And I was not satisfied with my game today,\" said Prinz.German coach Silvia Neid was watching anxiously as her team clung to a one-goal lead for most of the game.\"We did not want to wait for the opponent to score a goal,\" said Neid. \"So we tried to win this game. We tried to scores ourselves. We went for the second one. Especially for the midfield, it was not an easy game since they had to do a lot of running.

According to Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev, \"I hope we see the resumption of talks. I think it's in everyone's interest.\" Peace talks broke down more than a year ago, and the Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiating table until Israel freezes all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestinians rejected Israel's offer of a partial freeze. Regev says Israel has been ready to resume peace talks all along. \"And unfortunately that's been held up until now because the Palestinian side, unfortunately, has piled on preconditions,\" Regev said.The United States has also pressured Israel for a freeze on construction in the settlements, on grounds that they are an obstacle to peace. But the U.S. has not made a settlement freeze a precondition for peace talks. To bridge the gaps, the U.S. proposed indirect talks, which will probably involve shuttle diplomacy by an American mediator between the Israeli government in Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank town of Ramallah.",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him.

But experts say growth has been stymied in the past by persistent economic imbalances, driven partially by high levels of borrowing and debt.Two senior economists briefing reporters Wednesday agreed that past policies aimed at fostering development have had mixed results. Particular criticism has been leveled at what has come to be known as the Washington Consensus.The Washington Consensus is generally defined as a set of late 20th century policy prescriptions advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

So the relatively light sentence was seen as a victory. “I walk out of here with my head held high,” Olmert told reporters at the courthouse. But State Prosecutor Eli Arbabanel, who had pushed for prison time, said breach of trust is a grave offense for a senior public servant. He said the conviction shows that no one is above the law. Olmert had denied any wrongdoing in the corruption scandal that forced him to resign four years ago. But after the sentencing he was contrite. “I accept the court's decision,” he said, “and I will learn the necessary lessons.” By avoiding prison time, Olmert is eligible to run for parliament.",

Democrats need a net total of 23 to assume the House majority, which would likely derail Republican President Donald Trump's policy agenda.The polls closed at 8 p.m. and final results were expected within hours. Voters in the state were also choosing Republican nominees to take on incumbent Governor Tom Wolf and U.S. Senator Bob Casey, both Democrats.Pennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the state Supreme Court found that the current congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans.

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

I write with songwriters; I play with other good musicians,'' Starr told Reuters, noting \"because it's what I do.'' \"It's very hard for me to find a stranger these days because I've been around a long time.'' Starr has witnessed the music industry evolve dramatically over his 50-year career, and consumption is becoming increasingly digital with Apple Inc's iTunes and Amazon.com Inc as well as online streaming platforms such as Spotify and Jay Z's newly-announced Tidal. The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes. Starr himself still prefers purchasing physical copies of music. \"Streaming I don't understand anymore.

More than 10 percent of them have been under age 13.Human rights groups say child recruitment continues, even as South Sudan's government says it has committed to ending the practice.\"The continued recruitment and use of children by the military and opposing armed groups points to the utter impunity that reigns in South Sudan, and the terrible cost of this war on children,\" Mausi Segun, Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a new report this week.One 17-year-old who had been abducted and forced to fight attended Wednesday's ceremony while clasping his arms around his stomach and staring at the ground. He gave only his first name, Christopher.\"They told me to kill my mother,\" he said, his voice barely audible.After being seized from his home by opposition soldiers at the age of 10 during a period of localized fighting, he said his mother came into the bush to plead with his commanders to set him free.\"When she came they told me to shoot her or I'd be killed instead,\" the boy said.",

Those efforts have proven severely limited, however, prompting advocates to again push for more reforms.\"I think the reason that Native women may go missing at higher rates than other groups of people is very similar to the reason that they are at higher risk for domestic violence and sexual assault,'' said Sarah Deer, a University of Kansas professor, member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and author of a book on sexual violence in Indian Country. \"The legal system is simply not functioning properly [to prevent] these types of things from happening.''At the end of 2017, the FBI's National Crime Information Center database had 633 open missing-person cases for Native American women, who make up 0.4 percent of the U.S. population but 0.7 percent of cases in the figures obtained by The Associated Press.",

At a meeting in Berlin, leaders from eight European countries called for regulating financial markets and hedge funds, investment funds that typically lead to aggressive financial strategies.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit, said all financial markets, products and participants that pose a major risk must be regulated.Ms. Merkel also called for world economies to coordinate in establishing sanctions for tax shelters and regions where financial deals are opaque.The European meeting comes ahead of a London summit on the international crisis in early April of the so-called G-20 nations, the world's top economic powers. But it is unclear whether the Europeans' call for widespread regulation will be well received by other G-20 members, which include the United States, China, Japan and several developing nations.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the European leaders had also agreed on the need to shore up international institutions like the World Bank, including in their role in helping the poorest nations.\"We decided that the international institutions should have at least $500 billion to enable them not just to deal with crises, but to enable them to be able to prevent crises,\" said Gordon Brown.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped.

He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation.

The United States is sending a senior State Department official to the talks, and President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin signaled greater cooperation on Syria in a phone call on Tuesday. The White House said the two discussed setting up safe zones in the country, where a civil war has been raging for more than six years. Syrian TV said the Astana talks began with a meeting between delegations from Russia and Iran, another close ally of Assad.

Washington will be sending its first ambassador to Burma in more than 20 years.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the suspension of bans on U.S. financial transactions, investments, and access to credit in a meeting with Burmese Foreign Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin.\"This is a moment for us to recognize that the progress which has occurred in the last year toward democratization and national reconciliation is irreversible, as the minister said to me. The United States wants to do everything we can to be sure that is the reality,\" she said.Secretary Clinton praised the parliamentary elections that brought Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition party to parliament, but said some U.S. measures, including an arms embargo, will remain in place until the country's reforms are complete.In a video conference via Skype, hosted by former U.S. president George W. Bush, Aung San Suu Kyi said the suspension of U.S. sanctions against Burma, rather than their full removal, will keep the pressure on the military to stay on track with political reforms. \"I sometimes feel that things, that people are too optimistic about the scene in Burma. You have to remember that the democratization process is not irreversible. I have said very openly that we can never look upon it as irreversible until such time as the military commits itself to democratization,\" she said.With abundant natural resources, Burma is ripe for new business.",

Inauguration Day is an unbroken chain that stretches back 220 years to 1789, when America's first president, George Washington, took the oath of office.Inauguration Day, says Georgetown University professor Mark Rom, is meant to convey continuity. \"The inauguration is an incredibly powerful symbolic moment for the American people,\" Professor Rom said. \"Because it is the time when one democratically elected president leaves office, and another democratically elected president takes over office.

Tribal leaders are able to maintain this power in part because they are often themselves government representatives and/or religious leaders.“The tribal system has been politicized and the tribes no longer cooperate with each other,” said Abdulbasit Al-Mashwali, a leader of the Yemeni Parliamentarians Union, a government watchdog group in Sana’a. “In the past they filled a humanitarian role, but not anymore.

Syria, which is not party to the treaty, reportedly has been using cluster munitions since mid-2012, about one year after civil war broke out there. According to the Cluster Munition Coalition — an international civil society movement that campaigns against the devices — Syria denies possessing or using such weapons.Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch is an editor of ?Cluster Munition Monitor 2018, the latest annual report of the Cluster Munition Coalition, a global group of nongovernmental organizations co-founded and chaired by HRW. She said the use of both air-dropped and ground-launched cluster munitions had increased since Russia joined Syrian military operations in 2015, but that their use had fallen off this year.\"There are several reasons for that,\" she said. \"One is that … the territory held by the opposition forces has been shrinking in the past year. Most of the cluster munition attacks have been centered on Idlib. ... A cluster munition rocket attack a couple of weeks ago in Idlib resulted in civilian casualties. And there has been use of air-dropped cluster munitions in Dhouma and in other governorates.\"The Monitor said the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in Yemen continued to use cluster munitions in 2017. But Wareham said there was little evidence that such attacks have continued this year.\"It does appear that in the case of Yemen, the stigmatization effort has had some impact,\" she said.",

From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

He also scrapped reunification guidelines and proposed amending the constitution to change the island's name from \"Republic of China\" to \"Taiwan.\"China sees these actions as moving dangerously close to Taiwan formally declaring independence - something Beijing has vowed to stop by force if necessary. While the democratic island has been self-ruled since 1949 - the communist mainland considers it a renegade province.China's opposition Kuomintang organized Sunday's rally, calling on the Chen government to stop provoking China and focus on domestic issues.Kuomintang chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, spoke to crowds of supporters.Ma says there are many problems Taiwan needs to address - including corruption and the economy. He says if Taiwan gets its priorities wrong there will be a huge price to pay.Ma, who is the mayor of Taipei and considered a presidential favorite in Taiwan's 2008 elections, will be in the United States this week.He is to discuss a stalled U.S. weapons sale.",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

We see international armed conflict, internal armed conflict, criminal violence, inter-communal violence, super-positioning itself in the same context,” he said.Maurer said the conflict in Syria has long ceased to be a civil war. It has become a regional crisis engulfing Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said extremism is deepening some of the conflicts being waged, leading to increasingly violent behavior.“Two-hundred thousand people have been killed since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, 9200 civilians have been killed since the beginning of this year in Iraq.

Here's a look at some of the claims we've examined:MS-13 Trump: \"We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.\"The facts: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in a speech this week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ``and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members.'' On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ``our partners in Central America.'' That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. Opioids Trump: Changes in immigration policies, including more border security, ``will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.''The facts: Drugs being brought across borders are only part of the problem contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention, about 40 percent of the opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some are abused by the people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market.

The regional talks were initially expected to focus on countering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but recent turmoil in Pakistan has generated concern that Islamabad's problems are more serious. Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country. And it's not just that they are in FATA, the tribal areas. They are in our cities and that is even more dangerous.\" Pakistan has battled Taliban militants in its northwest tribal areas since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the fighting is now moving closer to population centers, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee.Professor Hoodbhoy says the government for years tried to ignore or minimize the spreading influence of the militants, without acknowledging that the situation continued to worsen. \"The present situation is where religious extremists - whether they be the Taliban or whether they be one of the very many other jihaidst groups that were early on nurtured by the Pakistan army - they are pretty much beyond control now,\" Hoodbhoy said.",

In December, international negotiators will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a new U.N. treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the climate change agreement that expires in 2012. In advance of that meeting, the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has released a new science report that underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for governments to act. The UNEP report presents scientific evidence that has emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its last report in 2007. The \"Climate Change Science Compendium\" affirms that climate change is accelerating faster than previous estimates. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner says evidence of human-generated warming is \"unequivocal\" and \"just in time for us to appreciate how the magnitude of change, the scale of change and the pace of change are in fact occurring.\"Findings from some 400 peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals and research institutes are woven into the report's chapters on earth systems, ecosystems, ice, oceans and climate management. The data show that global carbon emissions - which rose 1.1 percent from 1990 to 1999 - climbed 3.5 percent from 2000-2007. Rapid glacier-melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification will become complex problems, Steiner says, in a world whose population is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. \"And herein lies another vital message in the report,\" he says.",

He was under hospice care and died of natural causes, Hagan said.The Houston-born balladeer with a husky voice had such as ``Lucille,'' ``Lady'' and ``Islands in the Stream,'' the latter with Dolly Parton. He sold tens of millions of records, won three Grammy Awards and was the star of TV movies, making him a superstar in the late `70s and '80s. With his silver beard and folksy charm, the Grammy winner excelled as a musical stylist for more than six decades. He had retired from touring in 2017.Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer.``You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don't invite comparison,'' Rogers told The Associated Press in 2015.",

While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey. In comparison, less than half of those polled in 2001 backed reduced prison time. \"The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs,\" Pew researchers wrote. The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 through Feb. 23, comes as policy makers and top U.S. law enforcement officials reexamine the nation's drug policy to allow judges greater discretion in sentencing offenders, although some prosecutors have balked at the effort. The Obama administration has endorsed reducing prison sentences in federal drug cases, an idea some Republicans also endorse. Lawmakers in Congress in both political parties are also revisiting the issue.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy?

A day earlier, suspected Taleban gunmen killed a senior judge outside a mosque in Western Afghanistan.The latest attacks are fueling concerns that the Taleban has regrouped and is gaining ground throughout the country.In Southern Afghanistan, officials say many militants no longer bother trying to keep their presence hidden, and openly challenge local authorities.In the capital, Kabul, NATO officials warn of increased suicide bombings to come, after suspected Taleban insurgents launched four suicide attacks in 48 hours.But Afghan and U.S. officials maintain that the Taleban's latest offensive is a sign of desperation, not strength.\"Anytime you are taking the fight to the enemy, which is what we are doing all over Afghanistan - we are putting them on the defensive, and anytime you do that, one of the consequences is going to be increased enemy attempts to push us back,\" said the U.S. military spokeswoman, Lieutenant Tamara Lawrence.The latest attack occurred in the capital of Nangarhar province, about 75 kilometers east of Kabul.Officials say the provincial governor, Gul Agha Sherzai, escaped injury after a bomb exploded outside his offices.The bomb was hidden inside an army vehicle, and was reportedly meant to explode as Sherzai entered the building.",

The system's ability to intercept enemy missiles fills a gap in the current missile defense system deployed on the Korean Peninsula.The deployment, however, has encountered strong opposition from China, which is concerned that THAAD will undermine the strategic deterrence of China's long- and mid-range missiles, as well as the regional military balance.FILE - People watch a TV screen showing a file footage of a missile launch conducted by North Korea, at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, March 18, 2016.Rose also said the United States understands China's concerns, and has always hoped to explain that the deployment will not affect China's strategic deterrent.\"THAAD's single-stage interceptors deployed in [South Korea] would not have the range or capability to intercept Chinese ICBMs headed to the United States,\" he said. \"It is pure physics.\"",

At the Women’s Mosque of America in Los Angeles, male worshippers older than 12 are excluded, making the new Berkeley mosque the first of its kind in the country.“We uplift the female, and just as the Prophet loved women, we must follow in his footsteps and love ourselves and each other,” she said.Keeble is a 40-something convert from Christianity with a master’s degree in religious leadership from the Starr King School of Ministry, a seminary affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, which has donated space for the mosque.At Qal’bu Maryam, there is no imam, as the cleric who conducts worship at a mosque is called. Rather, female lay leaders will rotate in leading the prayers and the talks.About 50 or so women and men, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, attended the jummah or traditional Friday service, listening to prayer leader Crystal Keshawarz chant the holy Arabic words, “God is great” or “Allahu Akbar.”",

How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers. “It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle,” said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.A pro-Russian man (not seen) holds a Russian flag behind an armed servicemen on top of a Russian army vehicle outside a Ukrainian border guard post in the Crimean town of Balaclava, March 1, 2014.Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich. But for the authorities in Kiev and local politicians still loyal to Ukraine, the rapid pace of events were evidence of a carefully orchestrated campaign from Moscow. Moscow denies any role in installing Aksyonov, who is known from his business days by the nickname “The Goblin”. But even those close to the Kremlin say Russia picked him. “Moscow always bet on Yanukovich. But after the coup in Kiev on Feb. 22 ...

They had been expecting a more moderate increase.The Reserve Bank will now lend to banks at eight percent. Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao says with inflation running at more than nine percent, he has no other options. ?Inflation is expected to remain elevated for a few more months before moderating towards the later part of this year,\" says Subbarao. \"The challenge for the government and for the Reserve Bank is to ensure that demand is constrained in the short term to bring inflation down.?The surge in inflation was triggered by high food prices, which have jumped more than 10 percent in the last year and are hurting millions of poor people in the country. Hikes in fuel prices have led to a further spike in inflation. This is the 11th time that the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates since March of last year.

His father was a policeman and his mother was a homemaker.

So he was put on the books as a Hitler Youth member, but he never took part in it,\" says Allen. \"And in fact, he found a sympathetic teacher who allowed him to continue coming to classes, even though he didn't have his Hitler Youth card, which, in theory, all German youth were supposed to have.\"Allen says Ratzinger and his fellow seminarians were also pressed into part-time auxiliary military roles -- assigned to an anti-aircraft defense corps at a BMW munitions factory outside of Munich.

As the fighting continues to rage, U.S. officials stated repeatedly the election process had to be settled before President Barack Obama could make a reasoned decision about sending additional troops and resources to Afghanistan. Administration officials say the United States needs to make sure it has a credible partner in the Afghan government before any change in strategy. Analysts say the runoff election will add credibility to the new government and Mr. Obama applauded the move. \"President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think, have shown that they have the interests of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law and an insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done,\" said the president.
