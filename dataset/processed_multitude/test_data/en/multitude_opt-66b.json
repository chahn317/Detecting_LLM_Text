Security Council that \"everywhere, across the country, people need help and they need it now.\"Brahimi said, \"Even as humanitarian agencies scale up operations in response to the escalating situation, there are limits to what is possible in the face of an escalation that has now lasted for months.\"\"The sheer scale of the humanitarian situation in Syria is staggering,\" he said.Brahimi said the World Food Program's recent food security assessment found that in one quarter of the country's governorates — or about one fifth of the country's population — people have exhausted their food reserves.\"It is in such circumstances that, once again, people are forced to flee,\" he said.Brahimi said it appears that in some instances, the government may have used heavy weapons on civilian areas that would constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law. He also said reports suggest that many opposition groups are using small arms to kill government forces, which also would violate international law.\"In this context, and given the political stalemate in Geneva, it is crucial that U.N. assistance efforts are increased, without which the dire humanitarian situation will only deteriorate further,\" Brahimi said.He said the Security Council should make humanitarian access more systematic and reliable, and it must help the international community with greater coordination of its humanitarian response.Brahimi said that despite the growing problems, it is still possible to make further progress toward a political solution.\"The parties have yet to engage in any meaningful negotiations. The U.N. political process remains deadlocked,\" Brahimi said. \"But we cannot give up hope. It is imperative that the Council helps preserve space for such a dialogue to take place.\"\"Only such an approach can bring peace, end this humanitarian disaster, and prevent a further descent into regional instability,\" he said.Brahimi said that during the Arab League ministerial meeting in Doha last month, the participants called for a cease-fire and urgent humanitarian access.\"We reiterate that call today,\" he said. \"The Syrian people have suffered enough.",

But the youth group asked the Supreme Court to review the case and the Trump administration urged the justices to do so.

The two mosques and a third one in New York City are collectively called the Women's Mosque of America and led by two women who are imams, or religious leaders.Download our NBC 7 mobile app for iOS or Android to get alerts for local breaking news and weather.The debate over female imams in America is being played out as more women have begun seeking leadership roles in mosques in recent years, and as more LGBTQ Muslims have begun embracing their identities.One of the Women's Mosque's founders, Rabeya Sheikh, a 43-year-old imam who has been leading prayers at the California mosque and working as an educator for two decades, said there's a need for Muslim women to have a space of their own to worship and to lead others in prayer.\"A mosque is more than a building, it's about people coming together, it's about community,\" Sheikh said. \"We need women to lead it because we are half the planet.\"In February, the mosque held an initiation ceremony for 13 women on a rainy night. The new members recite passages from the Quran, the Muslim holy book, and three of them later led a public prayer session. The women will lead the weekly Friday prayer starting this week, and in the future, they will preach and teach weekly classes.Women can lead congregational prayer at American mosques, but they are not allowed to give the sermon that most imams deliver at Friday services, and many mosques do not allow women to preach at all.The Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago and the Islamic Circle of North America issued a joint statement in 2017 saying they did not \"understand why anyone would be so desperate to be an imam that they would go through the hassle and expense of petitioning a mosque to give them the job.\"\"Women cannot lead worship in the mosque because it is not part of our Islamic tradition,\" said M.",

Residents and merchants have long been used to the sound of American and British bombers roaring over the city, but on Sunday night there was an added buzz in the air.Afghan security officers say they have seen more than a dozen missiles fired by American planes over the past three days, but they were still shocked when they heard the buzz of a rocket-propelled grenade being fired at an American plane just before dawn Sunday.It was the first American attack on the capital in four months, since a U-S airstrike hit a house and killed six Afghan women and children.This time, there was no such outcry. Instead, the air raid on Kabul and another in the northeastern city of Jalalabad struck the Taliban where it hurts: its finances.The targets of the attacks on Sunday were four money exchanges and a bank run by the Taliban.The strikes were the first of their kind since President George W. Bush declared Afghanistan a war on terrorism, not just a war against the Taliban.\"We've learned a couple of lessons from the past,\" says Afghanistan's Defense Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar. \"When the United States attacked a house and killed innocent people, it affected the whole Afghan people.

Officials have yet to announce the cause of the crash, but are increasingly confident that it was deliberate.Investigators are looking into two areas in particular. One focuses on his training and whether it was sufficient. That investigation has become an impetus for stricter rules for training and to strengthen the role of fellow pilots in monitoring colleagues. The other is an examination of the events in the cockpit during the descent.The Federal Bureau of Investigation will send to Germany for analysis the two black boxes retrieved from the site. The French air accident authority said it expects to complete its investigation in six months, though this process will not yield the cause of the crash.In addition, Germany's prosecutor is running a separate investigation into whether Lubitz committed suicide or whether others are culpable.

It is the single largest humanitarian program in the region and also benefits many refugees in neighboring Arab countries.Agency spokesman Chris Gunness says funding from donor governments is “falling short of meeting needs, as has been the case in the past” and the agency has been forced to delay salary payments and to cut the food assistance it provides to more than a million refugees who are dependant on it.Gunness says the agency’s operations are threatened, not only by financial shortfalls but also by a “lack of support” by governments which can have a “catastrophic” impact on Palestinian refugees in general.The agency’s “Desperate Appeal” for funds follows warnings by its director, Pierre Krahenbuhl, that it is at risk of becoming insolvent in 2018 and would have to suspend programs unless funding was quickly found.The agency provides assistance to Palestinian refugees, both in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. UNRWA has already reduced its operations in Gaza and Syria and says it must consider doing the same in Lebanon.UNRWA Commissioner General Pierre Krahenbuhl warned in early May that the agency would need to lay off more than half of its workforce, including up to 70 percent of staff in its Gaza Strip operations, unless funding was quickly found.Krahenbuhl has said that the “chronic underfunding” faced by UNRWA has been exacerbated by a loss of $300 million over the last two years.UNRWA was created in December 1949 after the 1948 war that followed Israel’s establishment to support 700,000 Palestinian refugees who became displaced.

I agree,” said Secretary-General Ban. “But what worries me is the gap between that belief and the actions required to address the world’s most urgent challenges.”Mr. Ban noted that although world leaders had recently committed themselves to halving global poverty and eradicating extreme hunger by 2015 and 2020, as called for in the Millennium Development Goals, much more needed to be done to ensure that the 1.5 billion people still without health insurance received treatment and that 100 million more children survived.In his speech, Mr. Ban also noted that achieving these goals would not be possible without progress towards universal health coverage (UHC).“In low- and middle-income countries, the vast majority of people live without access to essential medical care – and many more live with fear that illness might bankrupt their families,” he said. “These realities demand rapid and coordinated action.”“I believe that we must focus the world’s attention on providing affordable and essential care to all in a timely manner,” he said. “That requires us to expand and strengthen our primary health systems to reach those most vulnerable.”The Secretary-General announced that a follow-up high-level meeting in 2011 will launch a UHC action plan.“This must be our objective: universal coverage by 2015, in accordance with the International Health Regulations,” he said.",

During the attack, some of the victims, including the suspect, were streaming the live video of the event live on Facebook and Twitter.” So begins “Using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to Follow the Boston Bombing,” a post on the Internet Journalism Review website that details the ways social media was used to follow the bombing.As horrific events become more commonplace due to an increasingly connected world, social media becomes a more integral part of coverage and response. However, the way people use social media can either be a force for good, helping to unite people in crisis and tragedy, or a divisive and hurtful tool used to spread hate and prejudice.In times of crisis, Twitter and Facebook can help to spread news about what’s happening in real time by using Twitter hashtags such as #bostonmarathon or #prayforboston. But when people feel they have a certain cause, the tools that connect them via social media can be used for their own benefit and the detriment of others.“As a reporter I think it is great. But the same tools have the potential to be misused,” says John Ferrugia, a former news editor and writer at TIME Magazine. “This was a perfect example of how social media can be used in a very positive way. And when a terrorist’s name is mentioned you’re only able to learn more from it when you’re able to access it live. That’s what we saw in Boston and what you might call a modern-day lynch mob could not have happened without the accessibility of social media.”In the aftermath of a tragedy, social media provides an opportunity to discuss and help those affected. For example, the hashtag #prayforparis is encouraging users to share their photos, videos, music and prayer requests using the image above to show support and solidarity with the people of France. “I had to start praying for the city of #paris,” one user said.",

This is the third year in a row that fewer than half of students believe the country will be better off in a decade.These results are from an annual poll conducted for the last 15 years by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) to measure the attitudes of young people aged 15 about education, society, the economy, democracy, and political participation around the world.In the 2003 poll, more than half of 15-year-olds said that by 2020 the U.S. would be better off than it is today, but fewer than half of the students asked this year agreed, and their level of belief has fallen steadily in the intervening years. Today, 40% of U.S. students say the nation will be better off 10 years from now, which is down from 44% in 2007 and 50% in 2003. Meanwhile, the percentage of students who say that in 2020 the U.S. will be worse off than it is now (47%) has increased from 39% in 2007, and 41% in 2003.In contrast to the trend among students as a whole, the percentage of high school seniors who say they plan to attend college has remained relatively steady. Last year, 81% of seniors said they would go to college, and that number was 82% this year.The 2008 poll also measured students' attitudes on two other issues -- global warming and the war in Iraq. On both of these, the poll results were similar to previous years. On global warming, 68% of U.S. students said that global warming is occurring, virtually unchanged from last year's 73%. On the war in Iraq, 68% said the war was a mistake, up from 65% last year.Gallup has asked an equivalent question of adults twice in the last 15 years.",

        "text": "“A Black Girl’s Guide to Natural Hair” is an intimate look at natural hair with an African American focus that is intended to motivate and encourage African Americans and the African diaspora to grow and maintain their natural hair.While the hair is the focal point of the film, there are discussions around the hair’s importance in self-identity, the social construct of race, hair care, cultural appropriation, hair politics, Black hair and beauty in media, and natural hair in popular culture.The film is also dedicated to the late Michaela DePrince, an African girl adopted by a French family who grew up with European culture but struggled with the identity of being an African princess. Her journey and death are important to the history of African hair as it provides the backdrop to understanding the historical and ongoing struggles and oppression of Black people.The documentary was released in 2011, directed by Dezell Reid-Thomas, a filmmaker, actor, and activist who works for nonprofit organizations including the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and is a professor at Montclair State University, where she received her MFA in film.The film features three women, two of whom are African American and the other, a South African woman who grew up under apartheid who had her hair forcibly shaved off by the police. The African women share their experiences as African women who are committed to their natural hair, while the South African woman talks about her own struggles to accept her natural hair.The documentary also shows the relationship between the natural hair movement in the United States and that in Africa.Natural Hair CareFor some women, their hair is not only a big part of self-identity, but also a political statement, particularly when they wear it in its natural state. The film discusses the historical discrimination that African Americans have endured and the importance of natural hair, as well as how women are using their hair to celebrate African heritage and culture.At the end of the film, Reid-Thomas discusses the importance of African hair as it relates to the hair culture of Africa. She says that the hair and the style of wearing it is a part of the cultural and historical heritage of the people of Africa.“It’s about self-expression, about self-identity,” said Reid-Thomas.",

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -Friday, July 27, 2018 at 6:53 pm |A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from building a section of his prized border wall with money secured under his declaration of a national emergency.U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam, Jr., on Friday immediately halted the administration’s efforts to redirect military-designated funds for wall construction. His order applies to two projects, scheduled to begin as early as Saturday, to replace 51 miles (82 kilometers) of fence in two areas on the Mexican border.Gilliam issued the ruling after hearing arguments last week in two cases. California and 19 other states brought one lawsuit; the Sierra Club and a coalition of communities along the border brought the other. His ruling was the first of several lawsuits against Trump’s controversial decision to bypass the normal appropriations process to pay for his long-sought wall.“The position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds ‘without Congress’ does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,” the judge wrote in granting a temporary injunction to stop construction.At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make progress in a signature campaign promise heading into his campaign for a second term.Trump declared a national emergency in February after losing a fight with the Democratic-led House over fully paying for the wall that led to a 35-day government shutdown. As a compromise on border and immigration enforcement, Congress set aside $1.375 billion to extend or replace existing barriers in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.Trump grudgingly accepted the money, but then declared the national emergency to siphon money from other government accounts because he wanted to spend $8 billion on wall construction. The funds include $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.The president’s adversaries say the emergency declaration was an illegal attempt to ignore Congress, which authorized far less wall spending than Trump wanted.“",

        "text": "Islam Times - Yemen's Tribal System Has Contributed to Deeper Conflict in the Country, and Needs to Be Discarded.In Yemen's armed conflict, the military wing of a tribal militia known as the Security Belt, which is believed to be backed by Saudi Arabia, has repeatedly clashed with the Yemen army, the Shiite Houthi movement and a number of other factions over the past two years.The US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit conflict-research organization, estimates that the Houthi movement and its allies control more than 70 percent of the Yemeni government, while the Saudi-led coalition claims it is leading the fight against the rebels.While the United Nations has been trying to salvage peace talks in recent months, the Houthis and their allies have rejected the idea of negotiating with the Saudi-led coalition or negotiating peace.The UN estimates that the war has killed more than 100,000 people since 2015. However, the real death toll is thought to be much higher.Yemen’s tribal system has been described as the “most important foundation of Yemen’s political organization”.Yemen's history of tribal organization goes back to the early days of Islam. In modern times, Yemen was ruled by the Hashemite family until 1962. The country was then ruled by the North Yemen Arab Republic, or People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), until the unification of Yemen on May 22, 1990.Today, the country’s tribal system has contributed to deepening the conflict, allowing tribesmen and militia groups to arm themselves, as well as to engage in other acts of violence.One notable example of tribal violence occurred in 2012, after the death of the late Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh had been forced to resign following a 2011 popular uprising, which eventually forced the military to turn on him.While attempting to flee the country to receive medical treatment in Saudi Arabia, Saleh was killed in December of that year by a rocket fired by a Houthi-affiliated armed group.The incident sparked tribal clashes in the capital Sanaa, with at least 40 people killed, which further destabilized an already fractured Yemen.Tribal leaders accused members of the Hashed tribal militia, which is loyal to Saleh’s son, of being behind the rocket attack.",

The Orbán government seems to be banking on the fact that this is not the first time that Article 7 has been used in the E.U.'s history, and that the previous occasions on which it was used have had little or no impact. It also believes that it has allies in Poland. In late June, Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of Poland's governing party, Law and Justice (PiS), announced that the government in Warsaw was drafting its own legislation regarding the regulation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media, and that if the European Union didn't like it, it was free to take any legal measures it saw fit. Poland's prime minister, Beata Szydło, quickly confirmed that Warsaw had been informed of the E.U.'s planned infringement procedure.The E.U.'s announcement last Friday was a watershed moment in the E.U.'s history.

But more Syrians are moving into this camp now because the number of displaced people inside the country is growing.The United Nations refugee agency reported on Friday that at least 1 million Syrians have now fled to neighboring countries.“There are a few reasons why people choose to live in a camp or even a tent,” the U.N. refugee agency spokesman in Turkey, Firat Ahmetoglu, told VOA.“One is the security situation, especially in the border area. We have a lot of displaced people in these camps in close vicinity to the border. Then, there is the cost factor. When we have a very large number of displaced people who are living in close vicinity of the border, they would have no choice but to be living in a camp,” he said.There are tens of thousands of people living in Turkey’s camps. But U.N. officials say there is no easy solution for these people.“What I want you to know is that there are no easy solutions here because the problems we are facing are long-term,” Ahmetoglu said.A Syrian child sits at the entrance of a camp for refugees in the eastern town of Tunceli, Turkey, July 28, 2011.Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million of the 2.5 million displaced Syrians in camps on Syrian soil. But the United Nations says this is not possible.“There is no capacity or willingness to host large numbers of displaced people. This would mean that you would have to set up a new city somewhere,” Ahmetoglu said. “This is not sustainable, and it is not a solution.”",

The study, published in the journal Nature, compared two long-running climate modelling experiments -- the UK-based HadGEM3 and US-based NCAR-CLIM -- to the reality of 2016-2020, a period which has seen the five warmest years on record.It found that the real world is tracking close to the same climate pathways predicted by the models. The two studies \"are both telling us we have to decrease our emissions soon, very soon. The longer we wait, the harder and more expensive it will be,\" said Andrew King, a co-author of both studies from the University of Melbourne in Australia.\"We have been seeing climate change impacts happening now for decades and they will get worse,\" said Chris Rapley, an honorary fellow at the University of New South Wales in Australia and a co-author of the US study. \"It is not just a future problem, it is here and now, and the main message is that we have not done enough, we must act to reduce emissions now,\" he said.This week, the World Meteorological Organisation revealed that in 2020 the average global temperature was about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This has been called a vital threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming will be felt, which will come in about 2050 at the current rate of emissions.The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) fifth assessment report published in 2014 predicted that the global temperature rise would be between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.",

This is the first in a series of articles based on the original document, the others on burnout.The article gives a very useful definition of compassion fatigue,‘Compassion fatigue is a psychological reaction (similar to burnout) that can develop as a result of repeated exposure to trauma, stress or tragedy. It can be triggered by working in healthcare, humanitarian assistance or development sectors, where exposure to death, sickness and suffering can be intense and regular.It is a normal human reaction that may result in some form of psychological distress. Compassion fatigue can develop when you experience repeated traumatic stress on a regular basis, as a professional who is working in crisis situations, or as an aid worker.It may also happen when you are a witness to or survivor of trauma and are required to regularly reflect on the traumatic incident and its implications. It can happen when you are exposed to repeated or ongoing trauma.While it is normal to experience strong emotions in the face of trauma, for example anger, grief and sadness, compassion fatigue can lead to prolonged distress and loss of joy in your work.’The first part of the article outlines what compassion fatigue is and how it can happen. The second part gives some strategies for coping.It is refreshing to read this article because it is clear, concise and offers practical advice. It is also quite accurate with the exception of its references to health care workers.Health care workers do not get compassion fatigue, they get burnout.",

The cathedral also relies on donations to maintain its status as a site of Catholic pilgrimage.According to NBC, the donation-collecting mechanism will work in much the same way as a contactless credit card.“You put your card in. You pay a few euros, which can be deducted from your credit card. You walk away,” Le Coz said. “We want people to stop for a few seconds longer in front of this magnificent site.”The machine will be fully tested next week after church authorities made last-minute changes to the device to meet with French security guidelines.",

Another 15 people were killed in various Taliban attacks across the country on Friday, including a bombing in the capital, Kabul, that targeted the country’s chief of intelligence.In northern Kunduz province, where the Taliban control many of the remote districts, the insurgents attacked Khan Abad district from several directions on Thursday and fighting is still ongoing, according to Mohammad Yusouf Ayubi, the head of the provincial council. Ayubi said the Taliban have seized several villages but the Afghan security forces are fighting back.The fighting has left 37 civilians dead and around 80 wounded, Ayubi said.The Interior Ministry confirmed the deaths of the police officers on Friday but did not say how many had died in the bus attack. The ministry also confirmed that the Taliban attacked security posts in the districts of Imam Sahib, Sayad and Sherzad.The relentless Taliban attacks underscore the struggles that Afghan security forces have faced since the United States and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. They have continued to fight the Taliban who have seized several districts across the country. The U.S. has meanwhile ramped up attacks, carrying out more airstrikes this year than in the last decade.Afghanistan is also struggling with an Islamic State affiliate that has expanded its footprint in the country, carrying out horrific attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians. The extremists also aim to overthrow the Western-backed government.The Taliban have refused to sign on to a peace deal with the Afghan government, despite repeated overtures from the U.S., saying a permanent cease-fire would only be part of the negotiations.The Taliban have also continued to attack the country’s largest prison on the outskirts of the capital. The insurgents have released hundreds of prisoners in the past two weeks and the battle has left parts of the prison in rubble.",

United States and United States v. Knotts.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion that the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches requires probable cause and a warrant when police use historical cellphone location information to track criminal suspects.In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that requiring probable cause or a warrant is consistent with the Constitution's Framers' intent, noting, \"It is not our role to create policy.\"Privacy advocates cheered the ruling. But law enforcement warned that the decision would have ramifications for investigations of terrorism and child abductions.In a statement, the U.S. Department of Justice said the decision will create new privacy protections for suspected criminals, though it also said the opinion could \"disrupt the investigative efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement.\"Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, noted that some types of location information \"are so inherently revealing\" that they require a warrant.\"A cellphone's detailed records can provide a window into a person's life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his associations and intimate associations as well,\" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \"These details can identify not only the location of a cellphone but also where that phone has been throughout the day and whom the phone user has met. The record here proves that an individual carrying a cellphone can be tracked over lengthy periods of time.\"",

Instead of using a check or money order to wire money, Kenyans have learned to use a mobile phone.The service, called Zuku Pay, is a money transfer service provided by Kenyan mobile phone company Zuku. To use it, people dial a number on their phones, listen to a voice-prompted message with a code, and enter that code, along with their bank account number, before pressing send.The service is part of a broader movement among global financial firms to leverage mobile technology, and it is catching on in Kenya. So far, more than 70,000 Kenyans have signed up for the service, which allows them to send money to other Zuku users.In the process, the service has helped Zuku, which operates in a crowded market dominated by the dominant Safaricom, to win new customers and carve out a niche for itself in an increasingly competitive mobile market.Some Kenyans say they have even grown more comfortable using the phones as their primary mode of communication. “My family is overseas and they would be able to send me money even before I get my pay and I could buy them groceries, pay for the house-help, and even school fees,” said Elizabeth Kimani, 27, a housekeeper at a government office in Nairobi.Although Zuku Pay is just one of a growing number of similar services that let customers wire money through a text-message-based system, it is one of the first to use SMS as a way to send the money, rather than using a voice call.The company is also using SMS to let people check their balances and register to use its Zuku Pay service.In addition, the company has been using SMS to promote other services, including its mobile banking and microfinance offerings.“",

When a sex abuse victim sues the church they are forced to turn over records showing they know of the abuse—even if they did not believe it or do anything about it. The records show the corruption in the Catholic hierarchy. We are seeing the tip of the iceberg of the abuse within the Church. \"The suit seeks the names of every priest or clergy member employed by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles since 1960, and an accounting of any credible allegations of abuse of minors. It seeks the names of any accused clergymen currently in ministry. “This information will, to be sure, shed light on the horrific actions committed by Catholic officials,” Jeff Anderson, an attorney representing the plaintiff, told The Atlantic. “But the light will also shine upon what these bishops did in order to hide their conduct. And the light will also shine on how these bishops, when confronted with allegations of sexual abuse, chose not to help innocent children, but instead chose to protect child molesters.” The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, but can be appealed to the state’s Court of Appeal. Anderson also plans to pursue similar suits against other dioceses. California is in the midst of a sex abuse crisis among Catholic clergy. Nearly 400 such allegations have been brought against clergy in California since 1980, when the state began requiring that sex abuse be reported. While the number of credible cases is low, that doesn’t appear to be due to a lack of abuse. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles reports that at least 75 priests and clergymen have been credibly accused of abusing children.” While the Church protected the abusers, those abused were not protected—so lawsuits are the only recourse.By David Graham, The Atlantic, 2/14/19A lawsuit against the Catholic Church has taken aim at one of America’s most famous Catholic leaders: Cardinal Roger Mahony, who led the Archdiocese of Los Angeles from 1985 to 2011.",

Obama is announcing new standards for private lenders in the hopes that these new standards will bring down college costs and eliminate the need for so many student loans.Many students, he said, are taking out student loans to finance their educations but are leaving school with debt that exceeds the value of their degrees. This puts an unfair burden on students who cannot afford the high costs of college.Obama said that private lenders have to meet new standards in order to keep federal financial aid dollars flowing to students. New rules will be put in place in order to keep down the costs of private loans. Obama will announce the details of this new plan at a visit to Iowa today.This new initiative is expected to include standards regarding how much a private lender can charge for a loan. The standards will be designed to keep borrowing affordable for students so they can get the financing they need to be able to afford to go to college without being burdened by debt.Obama’s plan to help ease the burden of student loans is expected to include some provisions regarding making it easier to refinance debt. It will also include changes that will simplify the repayment process.One of the goals of this new initiative is to reduce the amount of money that students borrow and to make it so that they are able to pay off the loans as quickly as possible.

But he has always been a conservative jurist, and Trump will be able to nominate his replacement, who will require Senate confirmation.“It has been the greatest honor and privilege to serve our nation in the federal judiciary for 43 years, 30 of those on the Supreme Court,” Kennedy said in a statement Wednesday. “I am profoundly grateful to the President for entrusting me with the responsibility of serving as a Justice of the Supreme Court.”“[T]he most difficult part of the job is knowing that every day, when I sit down to write an opinion, I will be ruling on matters that will affect the lives of all of the American people,” he added.The 81-year-old justice will retire on July 31, Kennedy said.Trump told reporters he was “very honored” when informed of Kennedy’s decision by an aide and said that he had not yet discussed possible replacements with the justice.But Trump told reporters he will “probably do just fine” when it comes to choosing Kennedy’s successor.“It’s going to be somebody from one of the lists (of potential nominees),” he said, adding that he knows some 25 people on the list.The news immediately set off a contentious Senate battle over Kennedy’s eventual replacement, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledging to move quickly to confirm a new justice this fall.“We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall,” McConnell said in a statement, adding that he looks forward “to working with President Trump to nominate a successor without delay.”McConnell has made confirming conservative judges a top priority during his time in the Senate.",

And, by the way, Obamacare has been repealed in this bill. …The Republican tax cut is projected to add at least $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that it would increase the deficit by $1.76 trillion over 10 years.)In his speech Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Trump said: \"We will never abolish our heroes, we will never abandon our values and we will never allow a small group of criminals and illegal agents to threaten our safety.\"The phrase \"small group of criminals and illegal agents\" is a reference to MS-13, a brutal street gang that originated in Los Angeles and now has thousands of members across the country.The president has repeatedly exaggerated the role of MS-13 in the recent killing of two Virginia high school students, one of them a Muslim whose family fled to the U.S. from Syria. Federal prosecutors are seeking to death penalty the man charged in their killings, an MS-13 member who was in the country illegally.TRUMP: \"We've saved the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price\" of drugs for other countries.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says Trump is referencing a January article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which Azar said found a 25 percent reduction in the average wholesale price of six of the world's most commonly used drugs. That equates to tens of billions of dollars in potential savings.The article's lead author, Dr. Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool in England, tells The Associated Press it's impossible to know how much of the drug price drop is directly attributable to the administration's actions. It mostly stems from the fact that the prices were inflated to begin with, he said.TRUMP: \"The unemployment rate for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.\"",

There have been proposals for help for low-income people, but I'm not sure whether they will be approved.”The government has already rolled out some programs to help Thailand's elderly.

Forecasters expect a dangerous storm surge as well as very heavy rainfall, which could produce catastrophic flooding in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia.The National Weather Service is also reporting life-threatening storm surge and the potential for the \"unprecedented\" amount of rainfall, which could reach 40 inches in some areas of North Carolina.Aircraft like Air Force Reserve's WC-130 are in the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week when there's a hurricane in the Atlantic, and this one won't be any different. The aircraft drop scientific equipment into hurricanes to help scientists learn about the strength and structure of the storm. The planes fly into the storm to understand the movement of the hurricane by looking at what's known as radar signatures. These signatures help meteorologists determine if the hurricane is gaining strength, losing strength or staying the same.These missions aren't easy, and these specially outfitted planes can cost more than $5 million. While they won't be flying directly into the eye, they will be flying low and slow.\"You can see the weather systems surrounding the hurricane,\" said Lt. Col. Stephen Brode, the aircraft commander for this mission. \"We fly through the storm. The conditions are not the best. There's debris around. It's very intense flying conditions.

President Paul Kagame, an African Union leader, has faced criticism from the United States for suppressing dissent and cracking down on opposition politicians.“If they say to Africans that they should follow this model that has made them successful, it is very dangerous,” Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said.Lugar asked Zogby whether it would be better to have a dictatorial Rwandan government, or a corrupt, autocratic one that would be easier to change.“There’s a difference between an authoritarian who believes that government has an obligation to serve its people, or an authoritarian who believes that government has an obligation to rule its people,” Zogby said.Kagame is credited with pushing for social justice in Rwanda through the elimination of inequality, poverty and economic imbalances. He has also used economic development to justify strong political control, which has been effective, but has also fueled concerns about abuse of power.The president won a third seven-year term by a landslide in 2003 and will now likely face only token opposition.“We need to find out what is the motivation of Paul Kagame,” Sen.

In it, he called for a “whole of government” approach to Afghanistan, and he acknowledged the obvious in stating that the country cannot be stabilized with “military force alone.”The speech reflects a long-awaited recognition that the U.S. and Pakistan must work together in stabilizing Afghanistan. As the two countries’ interests increasingly converge, the prospects for the success of the next phase of the U.S.’ strategy becomes more likely. But to realize those prospects, the U.S. and Pakistan must now move beyond the rhetoric and develop clear policy choices that can deliver the concrete results that both countries seek.Cheney set forth a three-pronged approach for U.S.-Pakistani cooperation on Afghanistan: building the capacity of the Afghan army and police forces, increasing economic growth in Afghanistan, and pressuring the Pakistani government to prevent the flow of al-Qaeda and Taliban militants into Afghanistan from its tribal regions. He also urged Pakistan to make greater efforts to fight the Pakistani Taliban as well as the al-Qaeda-allied Haqqani network, and to press ahead with the peace process.Cheney’s speech reflects an important shift in how the U.S. is approaching Pakistan. The U.S.’ Afghanistan policy for the past several years was largely a bilateral, military-focused exercise. In this context, the U.S. sought to build and expand an Afghan army that could secure Afghanistan’s population while the United States pursued its objective of ridding the country of al-Qaeda. To support the army, the U.S. focused its attention largely on securing and controlling territory around Afghanistan’s main urban areas, and on improving the quality and effectiveness of the Afghan government’s security forces.The administration’s new approach to Pakistan is more expansive and inclusive.",

Patel had last week unveiled plans to make it harder for migrants to enter Britain from small boats, pledging to double the number of border police officers and invest in the latest surveillance technology, including drones.Some 528 migrants from Africa, the Middle East and Asia have crossed the English Channel on 39 boats so far in 2020, official figures reveal. It is a record number for the year and nearly double the total of 269 who had made the trip by this time last year, according to the data. The migrants' arrival in small boats on England's south-east coast have received widespread media coverage in the country, with Patel and her government coming under criticism over the migrant crisis, reports Xinhua news agency.\"Since the presentation of the new plan for the Channel, the number of migrant crossings has risen sharply,\" said Pierre-Henri Dumont, a member of the National Assembly and the MP for Calais, on Tuesday. \"What we saw Monday, was an exceptional operation. Two boats were intercepted by the French patrol boats. But four boats made it to English waters and five migrants were arrested by British Border Force,\" he told BFMTV, the French public TV broadcaster.According to the MP, the smugglers are sending more boats to Britain because they know that, despite the presence of patrol ships and French Navy in the Channel, they will be allowed to land their passengers.",

There were some gaps in [US President Donald] Trump's policies which have been filled now and the talks are in progress with the Taliban leadership,\" Special Assistant to Pakistani Prime Minister Naeemul Haq reportedly said in an interview with local news outlet The Express Tribune.Pakistan has been accused by both Afghan and American officials of providing safe haven for terrorist groups and the Taliban and other jihadist elements that have staged terror attacks on foreign troops in Afghanistan over the past decade. The accusations also note that Pakistan's military has directly aided the Taliban in their fight against U.S. and Afghan forces.Pakistan's relationship with the U.S. has been on the rocks for years, as Islamabad has long sought to maintain a diplomatic relationship with both its nuclear rival and arch-foe India, while also seeking to improve its relationship with its historic ally China.In September, the United States removed five Pakistani terrorist leaders from its terrorist blacklist after being granted waivers for one year. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, however, decried the move as \"arbitrary,\" claiming that the terrorists in question were in fact not wanted by Pakistani or United States authorities.\"The issue is that these people are not wanted in Pakistan. If they were wanted, they would have been arrested by now,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal at the time.In November, the U.S. State Department released a report on terrorism around the world, in which it claimed that Pakistan was an \"important ally\" in the war on terror.",

But U.S. President Barack Obama was in Paris to talk about the economy with President Francois Hollande. After a short meeting, they held a joint news conference. Obama says leaders are talking about some ideas for short-term economic stimulus.“I don’t want to prejudge what happens when I see them next week, but I think there’s a lot of interest in identifying a set of practical ideas that might help boost the economy in the near-term, and then set the stage for medium-term growth as well.”Obama says there is a range of ideas, from measures to support demand, to steps that can be taken to improve the overall growth environment. But he says it is unclear if an agreement will be reached.“I don’t think anybody is under the illusion that in the coming weeks or the coming months, any of us have all the answers, nor do I think there is going to be agreement on every aspect of the way forward. But what I think there’s a lot of common agreement around is that short-term measures are necessary, but it is also the case that longer-term changes need to be made.”The White House says the meeting was a chance for Obama and Hollande to discuss their priorities and how they might coordinate their efforts.France has been one of Europe’s largest economies, with a government debt of more than 90 percent of its GDP.",

The five districts represent a mix of urban, suburban and rural areas, and they cover a wide swath of the state.For Democrats, the key will be whether liberal voters show up to support candidates who embrace the progressive agenda or stick with more centrist nominees. Many of the districts, especially in western Pennsylvania, draw from a blue-collar coalition that has traditionally voted for union-backed Democrats but has drifted to Trump and the GOP.That’s what Lamb faced in the 18th District. He ran as a centrist Democrat and won a three-way race in March, even though Republican Rick Saccone also embraced Trump’s agenda and ran on anti-union messages.Lamb’s moderate profile and his success in the district, which Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points, has many Democratic political activists in the state asking if that formula could be repeated in the upcoming primaries.“It’s not about left or right in this race,” said Bill DeWeese, the chair of the Greene County Democrats. “It’s about right and wrong.”Democrats are also trying to defeat Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in the 12th District, where they believe organized labor’s deep pockets will give the party’s nominee a chance to knock off one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country.There, the favored Democratic candidate, union lawyer Mary Gay Scanlon, is facing off against John Morganelli, a former county official who has campaigned alongside the president.

China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that Chinese and U.S. officials were in contact about the next round of talks.The economic outlook is also being clouded by the Trump administration's growing rift with key U.S. trade partners, including Canada, the European Union and Mexico as well as its escalating trade fight with China.The trade tensions have led to a slowdown in factory activity and a decline in investment by businesses.

The current prototype can be assembled from commercially available parts for just a few thousand euros.An Italian-developed robotic hand can pick up a bottle or a small child, and could be used in prosthetics, factory automation, search and rescue and more.The hand was developed by a team of researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, a branch of IIT, the Italian Institute of Technology, a top engineering school. The hand has five joints and weighs between 100 and 150 grams. A prototype was presented Wednesday at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Stockholm, Sweden. [7 Robots that Will Take Over Your Job]While the researchers' ultimate goal is to create a robotic hand that can replace a human hand, the current model is too heavy and bulky for such a purpose, the researchers said. So their first order of business is to use it in prosthetics.\"In the next months, we will demonstrate that a robot hand, made from lightweight, inexpensive materials, that can be easily put on and taken off, can grasp an object, and that it can perform basic manipulations,\" the researchers said in a statement.The hand uses two small servomotors, or devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical force, which can be attached to a patient's arm so it can move when the patient uses their muscles to control the robotic hand. The hand has a lightweight pneumatic artificial muscle that can be inflated to expand or deflate to make the hand open or close.While human muscles can move more than 100 times per second, the robotic hand can only move 10 times per second, so patients will need to train the hand for about two months before they can use it effectively, the researchers said.Currently, the hand is controlled through a computer and must be kept within 1.8 meters (6 feet, 2 inches) of the computer, although the researchers are working on a way to make the hand work without a computer. The current version is about 15 inches long (40 centimeters).The robotic hand was created by combining different technologies in different ways.",

The situation is exacerbated because of a lack of services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes.Shelter, legal aid, medical care and counseling are often hard to come by in tribal communities.The federal Indian Health Service (IHS), which serves 3.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, has a network of 250 health care facilities, but advocates say it's inadequate.\"If you go to these facilities you'll find long lines, there are people who cannot get an appointment, there's not enough doctors,\" says Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians.The IHS reported earlier this year that American Indian women are 11 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the general population, and that more than one in four American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime.The IHS says it plans to add services on reservation lands, but says some tribes are in no position to take over programs.\"We've got to find a balance between giving them some services and at the same time recognizing tribal sovereignty,\" says IHS Chief Medical Officer Michael Toedt.In addition, funding from the IHS is less generous than the federal justice system for sexual assault cases.\"The government is paying the tribes to handle most of these cases and it's not enough, so they're forced to turn victims away,\" says Andrews-Maltais.The National Congress of American Indians says American Indian and Alaska Native women are often afraid to seek services because the IHS has a record of ignoring or dismissing women's claims.\"They don't want to go to the IHS,\" says Andrews-Maltais.Other programs such as housing, job training and counseling are also badly needed.

We are going to get this done by the end of this year,\" Ryan, the highest ranking Republican in Congress, said at a news conference on Capitol Hill with other Republican leaders.House Republicans have passed a plan to slash taxes on corporations and individuals through a process called budget reconciliation, but the Senate's rules require the legislation to have a 51-vote super-majority to pass the Senate.The reconciliation process allows Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority but allows only tax cuts and cannot include major changes to social services.Ryan said his party has the votes needed to pass a tax reform bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 52-48 edge, with two seats up for grabs in early January 2018. The Senate will be under Republican control for the next two years, since the November election produced a 50-50 tie and the Republican majority in the upper chamber cannot be reduced below 51 votes until late 2019.But as a number of Republican senators are on record opposing the budget reconciliation process, the party's margin is limited.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his party will also need to pass a spending bill in December to fund the government.\"If we get both of those done, which I think we will, that's probably going to be the year-end deadline,\" McConnell said.Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will begin taking up the defense portion of the budget in January.The U.S. defense budget accounts for about three-quarters of discretionary spending in the U.S. government.",

The work is a collaboration between the US Agency for International Development and the Rwandan Ministry of Health. But the work is complicated by the fact that most of the doctors have never worked with anesthetics or advanced surgical equipment before.It’s just after dawn in Kibagabaga Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda, on the edge of Nyamirambo neighborhood. Medical students and local surgeons crowd the operating room waiting for the doors to open.The first patient for the day is a 6-month-old girl with her mother. She’s one of the survivors of the genocide, and they sit together in the operating room.Mama Marie is having surgery to correct her daughter's cleft lip and palate. Surgeons at the hospital are using a new technique with help from US surgeons.Dr. Muhumuza leads the team of surgeons. He’s been with the Rwandan Ministry of Health for three years, and he has the kind of deep tan you get from many hours in the operating room. He talks about the surgery and the challenges of working with anesthetics and with new technology.“I want to say this is not a simple surgery because the cleft lip and palate,” he says. “It is very, very difficult and I can say that the success is 80 to 85 percent.”The doctors say they’ve used the same method for 10 years. A surgeon puts on a clear protective mask over the baby’s face, then they pull it away to expose the incision.Dr. Muhumuza says this technique is a simple one, but it doesn’t allow a lot of room for error.“If any little mistake will be found, that's how the baby can die, so that is one of the major problems,” he says.The doctors here in Rwanda have the new skill for just two days.",

The clerics have helped promote a series of laws introduced by successive Bangladeshi governments that activists say threaten religious freedom and allow conservative religious leaders to silence their critics.In recent years, these laws have helped spur an anti-Western, anti-Israel, pro-Islamist movement that has led to attacks on liberal writers and an ongoing, bloody insurgency in the Muslim-majority state of South Asia.It has been years since Bangladesh’s founding father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, declared that “this country has no religion,” when the country was officially declared secular.But even as its people become more religiously conservative, the country’s laws remain deeply secular. Last year, a Bangladeshi blogger was sentenced to life in prison for criticizing Islam and religious extremism online.The rise of Islamists has coincided with the crackdown by the government and security forces on Islamic groups that have sought to install Islamic sharia, or Islamic law, since independence from Pakistan in 1971.“",

The most recent iteration featured Reagan calling for a “truly national effort to build a culture of life” by reversing a “steady erosion of our morals.”“A society without morals, a society that puts profit before people, a society that embraces greed instead of gratitude, is a society that destroys itself,” Reagan says in the recording.The Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute says this year’s event will “showcase President Trump’s achievements in keeping that promise.” Trump is taking credit for an “economic boom” and low unemployment.The event will be held in the 16,000-seat Anaheim Convention Center, and $50 tickets will be made available to county GOP members, the foundation said. There will also be a smaller exhibit area for $35 a person.Trump and Reagan, who died in 2004 and 2004, respectively, are among the most popular Republican presidents among the party faithful and are often mentioned as potential nominees for the GOP.",

That gives the LDP and its coalition partner a hefty lead over the Democrats.“It’s a dead heat between Abe and (Yukio) Hatoyama. It’s going to be another tight election,” said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Japan campus.The numbers leave Abe well positioned to win a ruling bloc majority in an October 22 lower house election.

The president and vice-president swear to uphold the Constitution and be president and vice-president of the United States, respectively. They are escorted to the front of the Capitol, where they stand on the dais with their hands on a Bible or the Quran (the vice-president has the option of using a Bible, if that is preferred). The elected officials are sworn in by the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, or someone appointed by him. The elected president swears by the Bible or the Quran that they \"will faithfully execute the office of president.\"The president then gives a brief speech, during which the vice-president and the elected officials repeat their oaths. This is followed by the president delivering a \"mandate speech,\" which is a written description of the policy agenda they plan to follow and the priorities they have set for their term of office. This speech is also given to the public on television. Then the new president delivers their inaugural address, in which they set forth their vision for the country and the path they will follow to accomplish that vision.All of these speeches, from the president's mandate speech through the inaugural address, are delivered in the House Chamber, which has been restored to its original state after its renovation in the early 1900s.The inauguration is a solemn moment in U.S. history and there are many traditions, many dating back hundreds of years, designed to create an atmosphere of peace and unity and to show that the United States is a nation of laws.

According to the story, Morgan Stanley is working with NEVS to explore a sale of its shares in Beijing-based Weichai Power Co., a partner of NEVS that manufactures engines, in order to raise capital for the Chinese automaker's U.S. operations. The report indicates that the U.S. operations will initially launch a small electric vehicle, likely a van.If the Chinese automaker does indeed launch a new EV in the U.S., it will be doing so just as the Chinese electric-vehicle market is starting to come to life. While China as a whole is the world's largest automotive market, electric vehicles only accounted for about 1 percent of passenger-car sales in China in 2016, according to Bloomberg. However, the Chinese government is aggressively working to change that, with a national goal of 7 percent of vehicles sold in the country to be electric by 2025.That goal has created some significant financial incentives for Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers, including state-owned automakers. For example, the government has been offering financial incentives of up to 30,000 yuan (approximately $4,800) for Chinese electric-vehicle buyers. The government also launched its own version of the Clean Air Act, similar to a program in California. The country also began requiring all new buses and trucks to use electricity instead of diesel fuel by 2020, and the China Academy of Sciences is working on a plan to build a nationwide network of charging stations for electric vehicles.NEVS has a long history in Sweden, where the company has been owned since 2007 by a group of Chinese investors, including the state-owned Shougang Group and Beijing-based Qingdao Doublestar Co.",

He told them they were not alone and urged them to hold on to their dreams.On Friday, the EU's border control agency Frontex proposed a seven-fold increase to 10,000 of its officers to better police the bloc's frontiers.The plan ran into an immediate wall of opposition from countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, which refuse to accept their share of any incoming migrants under a 2015 plan to disperse them across the bloc.The issue is a hugely divisive one in Europe, where a growing far-right movement has gained electoral momentum on a mantra of keeping out migrants.Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007 and adopted the euro currency in 2014, has seen fewer migrants arriving than some of its eastern neighbors.Still, the country was the EU's top recipient of asylum applications last year.'Not the solution'Francis said many people were worried and scared of migrants, and he praised Bulgaria's integration efforts. He did not refer to any countries by name, but appeared to reference countries such as Hungary.\"It is true that, in recent decades, it has not been easy to deal with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants.

An estimated 38 million people are living with HIV, and 1.8 million people became newly infected in 2019, according to UNAIDS.The U.N. health agency said the results of the study were “promising” and showed that the treatment had helped 96% of people keep the virus under control. Even when patients did develop drug resistance, the treatment seemed to be able to contain the virus, WHO said.“There is still much work to do but we have a new weapon in our fight against the virus,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation.Researchers said the treatment is a “significant step” toward an AIDS vaccine.“",

It went on to point out that the blood on the walls of the office was the blood of police who went inside the building when the terrorists were still firing.Al-Hayat also cited other alleged cases of bias, including reports of the presence of “Arab jihadists” among the Paris attackers and a Times headline that allegedly referred to the massacre as a “Muslim massacre.”The Arab press was also quick to denounce remarks by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls who compared the Paris attackers to Nazi Germany.Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the only Palestinian Arab newspaper with a circulation in excess of one million copies, compared the French prime minister’s remarks to U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump’s call to ban Muslims from the U.S.Al-Quds noted that Valls used the Nazi comparison when it came to the killing of Jews, but not of the Jews living in Israel, thus giving rise to the inference that he was making a distinction between Jews and Israel.“",

Violence erupted between the mostly Muslim Seleka rebels in 2013 and the Christian anti-Balaka militia. The former president, Francois Bozize, seized power in a coup. He was killed in a 2013 rebellion and Michel Djotodia, the Seleka leader, eventually stepped down in 2016.The U.N. launched a peacekeeping mission called MINUSCA in 2014 to help bring stability to the country. In 2014, the country had seen a low-level insurgency and international forces were on the ground to help train and support the national army.In 2015, the mission reached a turning point when French troops entered into combat. After a couple of years of intense fighting with the country's armed groups, U.N. forces were able to stabilize the situation.The U.N. mission has 12,000 troops and is considered the second largest in the world, after that of Mali.Last year, the government and 14 armed groups signed a peace deal. However, violence and abuses against civilians continue in some areas, and several groups have yet to lay down their arms.After French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will end its military presence in the Central African Republic, the country's president, Faustin-Archange Touadera, held a virtual summit with a dozen African leaders. Macron told the nation's president that France will keep some troops deployed there to help stabilise the country.In recent weeks, Central African Republic has been gripped by a wave of deadly violence.",

The report titled The Price of Politics: A Review of Attacks on MPs in Africa, Asia and Latin America, found an average of 16 attacks per year over the past 24 years.While such incidents occurred most in Africa, there was a significant spike last year when 43 MPs were killed.ISS noted that there is an \"increasingly deadly dynamic at play\", where politicians are not simply caught in the crossfire between violent factions, but are instead targeted by gangs, or are caught in the middle as political groups fight for power.The report, a partnership between the ISS and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), found that more than one-third of the killings, which were mainly carried out with firearms, were political or \"executive\".Most of these incidents were linked to organised crime networks, although politicians can be targeted for \"ideological\" reasons, ISS noted.The report also said that the vast majority of the incidents occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, with 91% of the 815 attacks reported taking place in four countries — the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somalia, Nigeria and South Sudan.Nigeria saw the biggest number of incidents, with 127.\"More than 40% of all incidents took place in Nigeria, where criminal gangs have become extremely violent as they fight to control territory and resources,\" the report noted.\"In addition to attacks on political rivals, politicians and party officials, and security forces, the gangs also engage in sexual violence and abduction, in order to recruit into their ranks.\"The other three countries saw a much smaller number of attacks, with Somalia and South Sudan reporting 19 attacks each, while the DRC recorded 37 incidents.The report noted that in the DRC, \"politicians are targeted for ideological reasons, as well as those associated with the ruling coalition, including members of parliament\".The ISS said that it did not attempt to verify the motives of all those reported, but noted that of those which it verified, \"most incidents were related to organised crime or local power battles between politicians\".",

The movie premieres Oct. 21 on TVLand.The plot: Jack is a blue collar guy, who, along with his brother, has spent his life working in his father's struggling garage. Jack and Liz grew up as best friends but stopped talking after Liz's father married Liz's stepmother — not to mention Liz broke off her engagement to Jack's brother. Now Liz's father is about to sell the house they grew up in, and both siblings want it to be a family home.Jack and Liz's father is played by Dennis Farina, a New Jersey native who started out as a police officer before moving into movies and a recurring role in Law & Order and Chicago Hope.Jack, in turn, is played by Marlo Thomas, whose film career peaked in the 1960s and '70s. In recent years, she's been on daytime soap operas and HBO's Hung.Whatever Works was a major flop for 20th Century Fox in 1972 and was panned by critics, but its title is a famous line from Shakespeare — the title character's last words to Othello.Copyright 2014 NPR.

This government is new. The new leadership is also very cognizant of that,” he said.“I would argue that Ethiopia needs help right now and that we can help in a way that recognizes and respects Ethiopia’s desire to manage its own internal processes.”Raynor said he had held “very constructive” conversations with Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, and that the U.S. supported the transition to democracy taking place there.Credit : Voice of America (VOA)Like this: Like Loading...",

Now the government is pursuing a controversial 6,000-megawatt dam that it says is a cornerstone of development and crucial to its water security.The dam is the largest ever built by Egypt, and one of the world’s largest, and construction began in 2015 despite fierce criticism from rights groups who feared it could disrupt the river’s flow and threaten the livelihood of tens of millions of Egyptians.Egyptians were initially encouraged to see their country was building a hydroelectric dam after years of drought had led to water rationing.But as work nears completion ahead of a 2022 deadline, the impact on rice farmers, and on irrigation and fishing communities, is coming into focus.‘Invisible’ damageFarmer Mahmoud Ali says the impact of dam construction on his delta land in Kafr al-Sheikh, northeast of the capital, Cairo, is clear.“The water level of the Nile has dropped so much. Before the dam there was enough water for farming for two to three months, now it is only one month,” said Ali, who like many in the area makes a living growing rice, wheat, sugar cane and watermelon.The dam is close to being operational but will not be fully completed for another few years.“There is damage that is so visible and so huge, but I don’t think there has been any kind of impact assessment,” said Ibrahim Sultan, a researcher who has studied the project.Farmer Ali fears that within a few years his livelihood will be destroyed.“",

William Russell, adding that the Air Force determined that it no longer provided “sufficient capability” to meet mission requirements.Russell told The Associated Press that there was little risk of the remains of USA 193 hitting any one particular spot.“It re-entered well above any population, land or sea,” Russell said in an email, noting it was the 65th such demolition since 1991.The satellite was decommissioned in 2008 after more than 19 years in orbit, but was kept in an orbit too low for its decaying orbit to take it out of the atmosphere, which takes a few weeks. It was dragged down Wednesday into a long, planned disintegration over the Pacific.The Air Force determined the satellite was non-functional and that there were no plans to recover the remains, Russell said.Last year the US military, under former President Donald Trump, was preparing to destroy a different type of satellite in order to avoid the risk that it could collide with a functional spacecraft. The mission was canceled at the last minute to examine whether the non-functional satellite's remains could provide additional insight into what happened.The US has been creating new space teams to better protect and defend its interests in orbit, and this week announced that Trump had appointed Gen. John Raymond to lead US Space Command.The military has also established a new Space Force, but that branch is not yet in charge of in-orbit operations.",

Two of those being sought by Interpol are in Israel, and two are in Turkey, with the agency offering up $20,000 for each of the wanted men, the Israel police said.The murder of Jabari, one of the Hamas terror group’s top military leaders, led to the Israel-Hamas war in 2014. The Red Notice does not represent a guilty verdict on the part of Interpol, but only the police organization’s interest in the wanted men. In a statement on its website, Interpol said the men were wanted for “murder and attempted murder, as well as belonging to a terrorist organization.”Hamas, for its part, said that the Red Notice represented “a major achievement for the Palestinian people. It represents a clear verdict of Israel and the international community that these terrorists committed a crime against the Palestinian people, against the Hamas leadership, and against the Palestinian political system.

Syria has not made the move to renounce its use.”In the 1980s, the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union developed cluster bombs, which are designed to explode after they have been dropped over a wide area, scattering smaller bomblets across an even larger area. But after a long-running campaign by humanitarian groups and anti-war protesters to ban the weapons, the vast majority of countries that once possessed cluster bombs have promised to destroy them or convert them to precision-guided munitions.“It’s been very, very slow going, and the cluster munition issue was always at the top of their concerns,” says Wareham, who is the arms division advocacy director at HRW.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has long called for an end to all use of cluster munitions. In his report on the Syrian war last December, Ban accused the Syrian government of “indiscriminate and disproportionate air attacks that killed and injured hundreds of civilians,” including the use of cluster bombs.In 2013, HRW documented the use of cluster munitions by the Syrian government against rebels, and in 2014, the group accused opposition forces of using the weapons against government troops.But in its latest report, published last week, HRW says cluster munitions have continued to be used in both directions in 2015.“Syria is the only nation that still uses cluster munitions,” says Wareham, who co-authored the report, “Cluster Munition Landmine Deaths Fall to 20-Year Low.”In a written response to the report, the Syrian mission to the United Nations said cluster munitions were “not used against civilian targets.” And it denied that any civilians had been killed by Syrian air attacks.The Syrian government maintains that it is fighting foreign-backed militants who have used heavy weapons to undermine the state.",

Even though a small number of protestors gathered in Liberty Square last weekend, the message and the movement have grown exponentially since September.Now, a group of occupiers in Zuccotti Park is seeking to re-establish a physical presence at the park. For those who don’t know the backstory, the park was shut down and cleaned out by NYC officials on the morning of October 1st, as protesters were celebrating two months of occupation in the area. But this movement is far from over.This video was posted on YouTube by a group called Occupy Wall Street General Assembly. According to Occupy Wall Street’s official website, the group is “a horizontal network of individuals organizing nonviolently to address the many structural problems caused by the concentrated wealth of the 1% in our society.”Here’s an overview of the movement:On September 17th we launched a sit in at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan’s Financial District. We are the people you want running the country. We have doctors, teachers, students, lawyers, artists, workers, and people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. We have created a community in the middle of the street that none of us can leave. We are the 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%. We are organizing to take the power back from those who’ve stolen it, and to create a society that works for all of us.Overwhelmingly, people are joining us.",

        "text": "The Ivanka Trump brand isn't leaving the White House anytime soon.Continue Reading BelowEven as many retailers including Nordstrom Inc., Hudson Bay Co. and Belk Inc. have dropped her line since her father's election, sales of the merchandise have grown.Growth in sales of Ivanka Trump branded merchandise increased to 27 percent in the second quarter from 20 percent in the first quarter, according to Rakuten Intelligence LLC, which gathers product data across more than 4,000 brands. That is compared to growth of 5 percent in the overall women's apparel category.Ms. Trump's line is also more popular than it used to be: Sales of the brand were up nearly 3 percent from a year ago.One likely reason for the growth is that her product lineup has become \"less niche,\" with more basics that can work in more settings, said Erin Schmidt, an analyst at the retail consultancy firm Publicis Sapient. Another reason may be that Ms. Trump appears on cable news or social media as much or more than her sister-in-law, the first lady, said Ms. Schmidt.But the increased sales have also come at a price. Nordstrom announced in early August that it would drop Ms. Trump's clothing line due to poor sales. Her company then sent out a press release noting that sales of her label had increased 24 percent year over year in the first half of 2017. The retailer had dropped her line in the first quarter.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTThe release caused a stir among retailers and led some to believe that Ms. Trump had a larger part in the business than had been previously known. It also touched off questions from government ethics lawyers, who wondered whether the Ivanka Trump brand was being used to boost her profile and perhaps even her father's.The White House pushed back against those allegations. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's transition team, denied to the Associated Press that there was anything untoward about the release, saying it was \"completely appropriate.\"Nordstrom declined to comment on the release. A spokesman for Ms. Trump didn't respond to requests for comment.In a recent interview with CBS News, Ms. Trump said she was no longer running her company, and said she had stepped away to focus on her work as a White House adviser.But it still seems likely that her brand is benefiting from her high-profile role.",

It has also put off a plan to start issuing bonds for the first time.The delay is a major setback for Dubai, which has been counting on such deals to fund a series of ambitious construction projects, including the $1 billion expansion of a theme park and an expected increase in the number of people living in the city from 1.5 million to 2.2 million in the next seven years.But Dubai has said it has cash on hand to meet its existing commitments, and it has so far avoided the need to ask its main creditors for a bailout.Still, as it faces a sharp downturn in its economy, Dubai will have to contend with rising labor costs and a growing budget deficit.The city, which was once a playground for millionaires from the U.S. and Europe, has attracted tens of thousands of construction workers from Asia and the Middle East and now has more than 800,000 residents. It has been able to expand its population through the building boom, but is now facing high inflation and a jump in its unemployment rate, which increased to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2009 from 8% at the same time last year.The city’s economy expanded by an average of 7.6% a year during the last decade, but most of the growth came from construction and real-estate activities.The city, which gets most of its revenue from the rent of its vast portfolio of commercial and residential real estate, saw its real-estate prices plunge by as much as 50% in the last year, according to a report by the Dubai Statistics Center.Property developers, who sold many of their units well before the building boom turned to bust, are facing sharp losses.“",

The presidential ballot aims to turn the page on the Central African Republic (CAR) crisis that erupted in 2013, but Touadera has failed to convince voters he has their interests at heart.\"We have a lot of hope and we're really looking forward to change,\" said a 21-year-old student in Bangui, who hopes the elections will offer a \"better future,\" given the insecurity and poverty.\"We just want a bit of peace,\" said a young man at a restaurant. He has taken to \"doing his homework from 9 a.m. until late in the evening\" because he is \"terrified of attacks\" at night. The streets, empty at night, are \"dangerous, especially at night,\" he said.The young people who spoke to AFP wished to remain anonymous. The armed groups, which have controlled Bouar, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) from Bangui, since 2013, have threatened to disrupt the vote. Violence erupted again in December.'Insecure'Last month, the UN warned the fighting had \"reached an unprecedented level.\" The UN said armed groups had taken over several towns and villages in the southwest, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes.\"",

This is an organized attempt to discredit Fudan Marxist students,” the newspaper asserted.In response to these “illegal and criminal activities,” Fudan’s police have launched an investigation into Wang and will also take action against “those students supporting Wang in his illegal activities,” the report claimed. “According to our laws and regulations, we will take an objective and fair stance on all the cases related to student activities in accordance with law,” Fudan University said in a statement cited by the newspaper.China routinely arrests its citizens over the use of illegal speech online, such as using a phone app to post a joke, and often forces those arrested to pay a fine rather than serve time in prison. China also employs internet censorship to block content from Chinese citizens, which often includes information that reflects poorly on the Chinese Communist Party.The People’s Daily did not elaborate on the exact legal violations that Wang allegedly committed. The legal system in China, however, places many restrictions on Communist Party critics and criminalizes speech the party does not approve of.",

It is scheduled for release on Oct. 23.The album also features contributions from two of Starr’s children: son Zak Starkey, a singer-songwriter and musician best known for his work with his band, the Starkey Brothers, and his work with Paul McCartney; and daughter Rory, a composer, producer and arranger who has worked with her father and George Harrison.Blackwell, who died earlier this year at age 83, owned Island Records with Chris Blackwell. He also co-founded EMI Records and started the Blackwell Music Company. He and Starr first worked together in the ‘60s, and he became a friend and supporter of the Beatles singer.Starr co-wrote the song “Every Breath You Take” with Bill Withers and released it as a single in 1973, after his band, the All Starr Band, played on the Rolling Stones’ “Black and Blue” album and tour. Blackwell played drums on that tour, and Starr also sang “Every Breath You Take” when the All Starr Band played on the Stones’ 1978 Voodoo Lounge tour. In 1997 Starr recorded the song as part of the Beatles-influenced album Ringo, an all-Starr band record of covers and originals that was produced by Starr and George Harrison.

That is particularly true in Europe, it says, where national governments often fail to coordinate their efforts.The report says the terrorist threat has also led to a tightening of visa and immigration procedures, particularly in the European Union, but it cautions there are limits to what can be achieved through such actions.The report says international terrorism poses a major challenge to the modernization of economic infrastructure in Europe and the former Soviet Union.The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is a multilateral, international financial institution which works with its partners in the World Bank to assist the former Soviet Union and Europe in their transition to market economies.",

Raymond Odierno said he was confident in the mission being conducted by U.S. and allied forces in Iraq, but he acknowledged the risks to the war effort posed by a debate that some observers say will be “perpetual.”“The only fear I have is if some of these activities were misconstrued, if people would think it means the troops are being asked to do things beyond their scope of capability,” Odierno said during a news conference at the Pentagon. “We’ve got great people here who are focused on their mission, and as long as we can continue to do that we’re going to be successful.Odierno, who is responsible for troops in the Mideast, stressed he was not speaking about the ongoing deliberations in Congress, adding that he did not believe anyone was seeking a change in strategy.The top U.S. commander in Iraq said he did not believe the troop withdrawal timetable was having any negative impact in the battle against insurgents in Iraq.“Right now it doesn’t have a negative impact on us,” Odierno said. “If the troops were able to stay in place because of the political debate it would have a negative impact on us because then the enemy will continue to strengthen and take advantage of the political debates that we have.”Odierno said U.S. forces in Iraq are capable of meeting their mission, even if the current troop strength of about 140,000 should be reduced.Asked whether the pace of the withdrawal should be adjusted in view of continued violence in Iraq, Odierno said, “We look at our enemy’s capability and our troops’ capability to achieve their objectives. If that is possible with what we have here today, we will continue the current rate that we’re going out at.”U.S. military officials estimate that the force reductions scheduled to begin this summer should bring the U.S. troop strength in Iraq to just over 100,000 by this fall.",

The site was a school before the Khmer Rouge turned it into a torture center where as many as 16,000 people were executed.Tribunal spokesman Lars Olsen said Nuon Chea was accused of being responsible for the systematic torture and murder of at least 12,000 Cambodians from 1975 to 1979, including more than 1,000 children.Nuon Chea also was responsible for the forced transfers of at least 30,000 people from Phnom Penh to S-21 to be tortured and interrogated, he said.Nuon Chea, whose official title during the regime was president of the Supreme National Council of Kampuchea, and Khieu Samphan are the only living members of the top tier of the Khmer Rouge and both were jailed in 2014.They have been detained while the tribunal considers cases against them, but both have been held in the prison hospital for months because of their failing health.",

Ragozin, who was a key figure in developing Ukraine’s counter-insurgency program during the Soviet era, says that Ukraine's leaders bear direct responsibility for this crisis and need to find a way back. He spoke to FP last week at his home in Kiev. The interview has been edited and condensed.FP: Tell me about how the Russian intervention in Crimea unfolded.Leonid Ragozin: Russian military forces had already launched into action in the region and were in control of the border crossings and the sea lines of communication. [Russian President Vladimir Putin’s] announcement about the intervention was made at 2 p.m. Ukrainian time. It gave them enough time to deploy to strategic targets.It would have been too much to just cross the border and start shooting in all directions. It was a long-planned and well-organized operation.FP: What were the most important strategic targets?LR: The main one was Sevastopol. They were already there before the invasion, but it is a huge port, and they were expanding the harbor. I believe that Putin was convinced that the Ukrainian military would not react.The second was the Crimean Parliament, because its legitimacy was a disputed issue. The third was to show the population of Crimea that Russia was going to be there for them. That's the reason that the military was kept in the barracks: to show that Ukraine was not going to engage.FP: Why didn't the Ukrainian military react?LR: The Ukrainian military is not a professional one.

But political change needs to go far beyond the doors of the parliament itself.Von SPIEGEL StaffIn the aftermath of the European elections in May, observers spoke not just of historic change for the European Union, but also a historic breakthrough in diversity.The parties in the next parliament will be the most diverse in the history of the parliament itself, they noted. Women will hold a majority of seats for the first time -- 56 percent of the total 751 seats, according to estimates by the Center for European Reform (CER). This will make the European Parliament look more like the rest of the EU than ever before.But when the parliament sits in Strasbourg to begin its first session on July 2, it will still reflect the continent's diversity only at a surface level. Of the 28 commissioners who will run EU affairs in Brussels and Strasbourg from the start of next year, only seven are women.Nor will a large majority of those attending be people of color. More than half of the incoming parliament is white; about a quarter is from Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Just one member, from the Green Party, will be from a former Eastern bloc country, Hungary. Only one Muslim woman, from Cyprus, will be in the new parliament. The parliament will include only three members of the Romani community.While the political world is changing to be more open and diverse, the makeup of the parliament itself shows that change has been limited and patchy.New Faces, Old ProblemsOn June 28, the day after the new parliament was formed, some 50 European parliamentarians gathered in the parliament building in Strasbourg for a discussion. Their task was to discuss the role of minorities.At the outset, some politicians argued that in itself the increased diversity would prove sufficient to improve the situation of minorities. \"The parliament will look like the continent,\" insisted the Dutch member of parliament Roelof van der Staaij.But most of those present were not convinced. Minorities have long been marginalized in Europe, said Sijbren de Jong, leader of the Dutch GreenLeft Party, and it is time to put that right.The members of parliament had gathered as part of a project run by a Danish journalist and his Dutch researcher, Maarten Hulshof.",

The salt reduction plan is an outgrowth of President Obama’s executive order on nutrition and physical activity, which was issued last month.The president’s order directs the Agriculture Department to cut sodium in food served by federal nutrition programs. In addition, it calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a multi-year plan to achieve the sodium reduction for the entire food supply.The American Heart Association is hailing the administration’s call for action.“Sodium reduction is a critical step toward improving the health of all Americans,” said Nancy Brown, the association’s CEO.But the Salt Institute, an industry group, says it’s unrealistic to expect manufacturers to meet the 30 percent reduction target in processed foods in just 10 years.“The only practical way to achieve such a significant reduction in sodium without sacrificing our culinary heritage will be for the Food and Drug Administration to set a sodium target for manufacturers,” said Kathleen Quinlan, the institute’s CEO.",

The crash occurred a few minutes later, at a height of just 100 feet, according to a preliminary investigation by the local police.Ms. Baturina, a former beauty pageant winner from the city of Ryazan, was part of a business group that built a banking empire that stretched across Russia, into the Baltics and into other former Soviet bloc countries.Her holdings included the oil company Lukoil and the airline Aeroflot. She owned a 50 percent share in the Bank of Cyprus, now one of the largest lenders on the island of Cyprus, which was forced to seek help in 2013 after a banking crisis.",

She said he forced her to have sex with other men and raped her repeatedly. When she tried to escape, he threatened to kill her.After the verdict, she was so nervous that she struggled to sit down. She smiled and waved to reporters as she was escorted away.The Associated Press doesn't usually identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they have spoken publicly, but the woman requested anonymity.The judge must now decide what amount of compensation to award her. She had originally been given AUD$450,000 ($341,000) by the government, but took the case to court to try and get more. The Australian government will pay any amount the judge decides.In his ruling, Justice John Logan said there was a \"substantial\" chance the man, identified in the ruling by the pseudonym Thomas Joseph Sweeney, had indeed threatened to kill the woman if she didn't have sex with his associates and that she would not have come to Australia if she wasn't given false promises.The judge said the woman was a \"good witness\" whose evidence was consistent over time.\"It is very unlikely that a person would make up such a story,\" Logan said.The woman's lawyer, George Vlahakis, said the case could pave the way for better outcomes for human-trafficking victims who find it difficult to prove that they were coerced into sexual activities.\"",

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country.

According to Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev, \"I hope we see the resumption of talks.

The Palestinians rejected Israel's offer of a partial freeze. Regev says Israel has been ready to resume peace talks all along. \"And unfortunately that's been held up until now because the Palestinian side, unfortunately, has piled on preconditions,\" Regev said.The United States has also pressured Israel for a freeze on construction in the settlements, on grounds that they are an obstacle to peace. But the U.S. has not made a settlement freeze a precondition for peace talks.

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him.

But experts say growth has been stymied in the past by persistent economic imbalances, driven partially by high levels of borrowing and debt.Two senior economists briefing reporters Wednesday agreed that past policies aimed at fostering development have had mixed results.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

Although some low-level militant operatives have been arrested, police have made no headway in identifying those planning the attacks.

The WFP executive director says the influx of refugees is creating a regional crisis because of food shortages and lack of resources. She calls the conditions in CAR a level-three humanitarian disaster, the most serious that the UN seeks to address, based on the large number of victims. Cousin estimates more than 800,000 are internally displaced or have fled CAR as refugees. The WFP relief teams have provided food aid to about 300,000 in the last four months, but must now increase funding to feed at least a million needy, she says. “And the most challenging issue is that we do not have the resources to support the purchase of commodities …” says Cousin. To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence. Many were suffering from severe injuries from traumatic attacks.",

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was fined $18,000 on corruption charges, but a Jerusalem court decided that he will not serve time in prison. Olmert was convicted of breach of trust in July for helping allocate government contracts to cronies while he was minister of trade and industry. But he was acquitted of weightier charges such as accepting envelopes stuffed with cash from an American Jewish businessman. So the relatively light sentence was seen as a victory. “I walk out of here with my head held high,” Olmert told reporters at the courthouse. But State Prosecutor Eli Arbabanel, who had pushed for prison time, said breach of trust is a grave offense for a senior public servant. He said the conviction shows that no one is above the law. Olmert had denied any wrongdoing in the corruption scandal that forced him to resign four years ago. But after the sentencing he was contrite. “I accept the court's decision,” he said, “and I will learn the necessary lessons.” By avoiding prison time, Olmert is eligible to run for parliament.",

Democrats need a net total of 23 to assume the House majority, which would likely derail Republican President Donald Trump's policy agenda.The polls closed at 8 p.m. and final results were expected within hours. Voters in the state were also choosing Republican nominees to take on incumbent Governor Tom Wolf and U.S. Senator Bob Casey, both Democrats.Pennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the state Supreme Court found that the current congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans.

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks.

Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes.

At a meeting in Berlin, leaders from eight European countries called for regulating financial markets and hedge funds, investment funds that typically lead to aggressive financial strategies.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit, said all financial markets, products and participants that pose a major risk must be regulated.Ms. Merkel also called for world economies to coordinate in establishing sanctions for tax shelters and regions where financial deals are opaque.The European meeting comes ahead of a London summit on the international crisis in early April of the so-called G-20 nations, the world's top economic powers. But it is unclear whether the Europeans' call for widespread regulation will be well received by other G-20 members, which include the United States, China, Japan and several developing nations.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the European leaders had also agreed on the need to shore up international institutions like the World Bank, including in their role in helping the poorest nations.\"We decided that the international institutions should have at least $500 billion to enable them not just to deal with crises, but to enable them to be able to prevent crises,\" said Gordon Brown.",

In a speech this week in London, he warned that withdrawing aid would \"create a leadership vacuum that others will fill.\"Gates, who gives $5 billion a year to development aid through the foundation he set up with his wife, Melinda, is one of the world's most generous philanthropists. In a speech at London's Royal United Services Institute this week, he voiced fears that the political tide is turning against foreign aid.\"It concerns me that some world leaders are misinterpreting recent events as reasons to turn inward instead of seeing them for what they are: problems that although they are difficult and will take time, can be solved — if we invest in the long-term solutions that are necessary,\" Gates said.Watch: Billionaire Philanthropist Bill Gates Warns Against Cuts to Aid BudgetsThe United States remains by far the world's biggest donor, funding long-term programs and emergency relief across the globe. But President Donald Trump is proposing significant cuts to the $43-billion foreign aid budget as part of efforts to reduce government debt.Gates argues that many critics of foreign aid don't realize the major progress that has been achieved.\"If you could only pick one number to highlight the effectiveness of the development agenda since 1990, I would pick the number 122 million. That's the number of children's lives that have been saved,\" he said.He disputed the notion that funding foreign aid is a bottomless pit.\"As you bring down that childhood death rate, families choose to have less children,” he said. “The population goes down very substantially.",

Tribal leaders are able to maintain this power in part because they are often themselves government representatives and/or religious leaders.“The tribal system has been politicized and the tribes no longer cooperate with each other,” said Abdulbasit Al-Mashwali, a leader of the Yemeni Parliamentarians Union, a government watchdog group in Sana’a. “In the past they filled a humanitarian role, but not anymore.

It is her job to identify the species that are sucked into aircraft engines.\"The information we provide on species identification allows engineers to determine the weights of birds,\" Dove said. \"So when they design a new engine they take into account the weights of the bird that are ingested into these engines.\"Dove says Canadian geese weigh on average 3.6 kilograms (eight pounds), but that the average engine is designed only to withstand a bird half that size.Solution includes redesigning enginesJust as windshields have been redesigned to withstand bird impacts, Dove says engines might also need to be redesigned, though refitting them is a costly undertaking.

And of course in these times anyone who is thinking realizes that national borders have very little relevance to the global crises that are affecting us – climate crisis for one thing. It does not respect national or state or continental borders. So in this moment the most urgent and stimulating issue that’s driving my work is really the planetary crisis we’re in and how we come together as humanity to address it.Click here to hear David Byrd's interview with Shailja Patel on poetry.Some of that crisis is man-made, situations like the takeover in Crimea or the Central African Republic or the situation in Afghanistan as they are heading toward elections. Does that inspire you more than just the general situation of humanity or do you find that these things pop up and you are almost compelled to write about them.PATEL: I believe one of the most important things I do with my work is to connect the dots between what we think of as political or geopolitical conflict, and the struggle – the fundamental struggle – over resources.",

She would get up really early in the morning and get us ready for school, go to work, come home and help us with homework, then go back to work until two in the morning. So the work ethic and the sacrifice, we saw what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. She had startups in software and she'd sold them and she started new startups. So, she was your quintessential Silicon Valley entrepreneur,” says Larco.Vanessa Larco graduated with honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. She says her mother too was in computer science in the 1970s.Larco’s first job was with the technology company, Microsoft.“Microsoft was a great experience in the sense that I got an idea of how you do things at scale for a huge company. I worked on Xbox, Kinect V1 and there was hundreds of people on this project. There's a lot of discipline. There's a lot of process. And so that was a great experience,” she says.Working three years for Microsoft, Larco left the world of product management and building and delivering software which she loved to come into venture capital.

Syria, which is not party to the treaty, reportedly has been using cluster munitions since mid-2012, about one year after civil war broke out there.

She said the use of both air-dropped and ground-launched cluster munitions had increased since Russia joined Syrian military operations in 2015, but that their use had fallen off this year.\"There are several reasons for that,\" she said. \"One is that … the territory held by the opposition forces has been shrinking in the past year. Most of the cluster munition attacks have been centered on Idlib. ... A cluster munition rocket attack a couple of weeks ago in Idlib resulted in civilian casualties. And there has been use of air-dropped cluster munitions in Dhouma and in other governorates.\"The Monitor said the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in Yemen continued to use cluster munitions in 2017. But Wareham said there was little evidence that such attacks have continued this year.\"It does appear that in the case of Yemen, the stigmatization effort has had some impact,\" she said.",

The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime.

They have staged a number of demonstrations recently, some of which are turning violent.Ivorian police used tear gas to disperse one of the protests, after leaders of a student association started burning cars. The association was angry that three students were arrested Monday for taking their own security measures to control theft on a university campus.Tuesday, the same students staged a violent protest, slashing tires in front of a private high school in Abidjan where teachers have gone on strike to force the adoption of school uniforms.The teachers say they are attacked by unidentified assailants when they give out poor grades, and that only uniformed students should be allowed inside the school to prevent such incidents.Meanwhile, students displaced by the 17-month Ivorian civil war, who have been denied aid money promised to them last year, are boycotting classes this week. They say they have been living in wretched conditions, sometimes 10 to a small room, and some of them have even turned to prostitution.School protests are not unique to Ivory Coast. Student and teacher demonstrations have also taken place recently in Mauritania, Guinea, and Gabon, where schools have become what some students describe as wastelands.At the Nouakchott University in the Mauritanian capital, which has 12-thousand students, many of them from remote areas, students went on strike Tuesday.One of the organizers, Suleiman Diallo, who comes from the country's interior, says poor students need more aid money because room and transportation fees are too high.",

The Monday edition of the newspaper ran an article titled “Islam is the target,” and said that “9/11 and the latest Paris attacks are aimed at hindering people from choosing Islam.”The news outlet Akit used harsher language in criticizing France with a headline saying “they burned places, so they got burned.”‘‘The attacks happened as a result of France’s Libya airstrikes,” the newspaper wrote.The news web site Milli Gazete echoed a similar theme with a headline “Boomerang.”",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

We see international armed conflict, internal armed conflict, criminal violence, inter-communal violence, super-positioning itself in the same context,” he said.Maurer said the conflict in Syria has long ceased to be a civil war. It has become a regional crisis engulfing Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said extremism is deepening some of the conflicts being waged, leading to increasingly violent behavior.“Two-hundred thousand people have been killed since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, 9200 civilians have been killed since the beginning of this year in Iraq.

        "text": "WASHINGTON - The AP is fact-checking prepared remarks from President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech. Here's a look at some of the claims we've examined:MS-13 Trump: \"We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.\"The facts: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in a speech this week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ``and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members.'' On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ``our partners in Central America.'' That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. Opioids Trump: Changes in immigration policies, including more border security, ``will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.''The facts: Drugs being brought across borders are only part of the problem contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention, about 40 percent of the opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some are abused by the people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market. The flow of heroin into the U.S. from Mexico is a major problem, but drugs that are brought from other countries don't all come over land borders.",

The regional talks were initially expected to focus on countering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but recent turmoil in Pakistan has generated concern that Islamabad's problems are more serious. Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country. And it's not just that they are in FATA, the tribal areas. They are in our cities and that is even more dangerous.\" Pakistan has battled Taliban militants in its northwest tribal areas since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, but the fighting is now moving closer to population centers, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee.Professor Hoodbhoy says the government for years tried to ignore or minimize the spreading influence of the militants, without acknowledging that the situation continued to worsen. \"The present situation is where religious extremists - whether they be the Taliban or whether they be one of the very many other jihaidst groups that were early on nurtured by the Pakistan army - they are pretty much beyond control now,\" Hoodbhoy said.",

In December, international negotiators will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a new U.N. treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the climate change agreement that expires in 2012. In advance of that meeting, the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has released a new science report that underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for governments to act. The UNEP report presents scientific evidence that has emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its last report in 2007. The \"Climate Change Science Compendium\" affirms that climate change is accelerating faster than previous estimates. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner says evidence of human-generated warming is \"unequivocal\" and \"just in time for us to appreciate how the magnitude of change, the scale of change and the pace of change are in fact occurring.\"Findings from some 400 peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals and research institutes are woven into the report's chapters on earth systems, ecosystems, ice, oceans and climate management. The data show that global carbon emissions - which rose 1.1 percent from 1990 to 1999 - climbed 3.5 percent from 2000-2007. Rapid glacier-melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification will become complex problems, Steiner says, in a world whose population is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. \"And herein lies another vital message in the report,\" he says.",

Sadigov claimed that the journalist's captors planted 10,000 euros ($11,180) on him, which led to the charges. Eldar Sultanov, spokesman for the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General's Office, said the journalist was detained late on Monday \"after illegally crossing the Azerbaijani border\" with a large sum of money. Mukhtarli left Azerbaijan in 2015, around the time when several Azerbaijani journalists working for foreign or local independent media faced charges of tax evasion. Mukhtarli's wife, Leila Mustafayeva, told the AP she was waiting for her husband at home Monday evening but he never showed up.",

Afghan authorities have suggested that an attack on a luxury hotel in Kabul and attacks on electoral commission offices in recent days have been carried out by “foreign intelligence agencies.” On Sunday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry by phone, urging Washington to help the situation by putting pressure on Pakistan’s spy agency. Pakistan's advisor on foreign policy and national security, Sartaj Aziz, denied the allegations, suggesting they are part of election-season politics in Afghanistan. In an interview with VOA, Aziz said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government has tried to improve relations with Kabul. He said Pakistani authorities believed they had convinced President Karzai it has no favorites in Afghanistan and strictly adheres to a policy of non-interference. Aziz claims the diplomatic outreach succeeded in connecting with many Afghan political factions, including leaders of the former Northern Alliance, and had improved overall relations. But the latest allegations are a setback. “It is rather unfortunate because there is no justification for it. What do we get out of disrupting the elections? For us, a smooth transition in Afghanistan is absolutely critical because without peace and stability in Afghanistan Pakistan cannot be stable. So, therefore it is important that this thing is reviewed,” said Aziz, referring to the leveling of accusations.",

While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey. In comparison, less than half of those polled in 2001 backed reduced prison time. \"The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs,\" Pew researchers wrote. The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 through Feb. 23, comes as policy makers and top U.S. law enforcement officials reexamine the nation's drug policy to allow judges greater discretion in sentencing offenders, although some prosecutors have balked at the effort. The Obama administration has endorsed reducing prison sentences in federal drug cases, an idea some Republicans also endorse.

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy?

Now he is a presidential contender.The graying, spectacled man best known by his alias Timochenko launched his bid Saturday to lead the government he once battled from the jungle with a celebratory campaign kickoff featuring giant posters, colorful confetti and a catchy jingle.“I promise to lead a government that propels the birth of a new Colombia,” he said. “A government that at last represents the interests of the poor.”Breaking with the traditional campaign launch from a five-star Bogota hotel, Timochenko initiated his presidential bid from one of the city’s poorest, most crime ridden neighborhoods in a clear nod to the underprivileged class whose votes the ex-combatants are hoping to win. Hundreds gathered in the parking lot of a community center decorated with banners featuring a smiling Timochenko sporting a neatly trimmed beard, angular, thick-rimmed glasses, and a crisp blue shirt.“Timo president,” a new campaign song played from loudspeakers. “For the people.”From rebel force to political oneThe campaign is another historic step in transforming the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into a political party following the signing of a 2016 peace accord ending more than a half-century of conflict.",

While both presidential frontrunners said they were confident of victory, critics said this messy situation was part of the plan all along to keep the ruling coalition firmly in control. President Joseph Kabila has remained in power more than two years past the end of his second term mandate.Observers from the Catholic Church observation mission said the poll had been relatively calm; but, the mood in the capital was tense, and local media reported that internet access had suddenly been cut for an untold number of residents. Sunday's vote was originally supposed to take place in 2016 but postponed numerous times due to what officials termed organizational problems.The most recent delay came when a fire at a Kinshasa election depot destroyed thousands of voting machines. Then, in three districts considered opposition strongholds, the government postponed the election yet again, effectively taking a million people out of the voting process.In the rainy capital, Kinshasa, some voters said they waited more than five hours Sunday to cast ballots.\"I came to sanction Mr.",

At the Women’s Mosque of America in Los Angeles, male worshippers older than 12 are excluded, making the new Berkeley mosque the first of its kind in the country.“We uplift the female, and just as the Prophet loved women, we must follow in his footsteps and love ourselves and each other,” she said.Keeble is a 40-something convert from Christianity with a master’s degree in religious leadership from the Starr King School of Ministry, a seminary affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, which has donated space for the mosque.At Qal’bu Maryam, there is no imam, as the cleric who conducts worship at a mosque is called. Rather, female lay leaders will rotate in leading the prayers and the talks.About 50 or so women and men, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, attended the jummah or traditional Friday service, listening to prayer leader Crystal Keshawarz chant the holy Arabic words, “God is great” or “Allahu Akbar.”",
