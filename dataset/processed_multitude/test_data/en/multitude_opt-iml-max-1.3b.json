        "text": "For more than an hour, the candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020 gathered at Los Angeles’ Staples Center to take part in the second presidential debate on Oct. 15. Democratic voters are likely to cast their ballot before then but, before then, have plenty of other things to consider.Here’s a look at some of the things that will come up during the debate and the things they have said about race relations, the climate and the economy, and everything in between.The first presidential debate, in June, was dominated by issues like sexual misconduct, racial injustice and white privilege.But in the last debate, the stage was expanded to include three more African American candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.); and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).That means that the first six of the first 14 candidates qualified for the second debate. With that amount of candidates, there will be plenty of hot topics.Here is a roundup of the most notable quotes from both the Democratic candidates and the moderator from the debate:Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke speaks onstage at a debate hosted by PBS on Oct. 15, 2019, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)The environmentHarris is the only female candidate who has been to the summit of Mount Everest, but she’s only addressed climate change in one of her campaigns: during her 2018 Senate campaign in California, she called climate change “the most important issue” facing the country and called for a Green New Deal to address its impact on communities such as the Navajo Nation in Arizona.“But just think of all the people who are going to suffer, who are going to die, who are going to be pushed into living in the streets,” Harris said last week. “What are we going to do about this?”The answer isn’t necessarily to ban fracking, but to pass laws in every state that require it to be a necessary part of the process, she said. She also said she’d support a ban on the use of the pesticide neonicotinoid.Climate change and energyThis isn’t a debate the Democratic nominee should lose, because it is the central theme of the next four years.",

He has no legitimacy,” Abdullah said, according to AFP, which was traveling with him on his way to the Afghan presidential palace.He reiterated his contention that Karzai was a puppet master to Ashraf Ghani, the incumbent, and that he was only seeking his re-election to continue being “Afghanistan’s poodle.”Abdullah said Ghani would have been better off for now by accepting a cease-fire between the Taliban and government forces, and then running a transparent election. “If a legitimate president wants to run, then the people should choose him. If the election is a fraud, then the people should punish those who committed the fraud,” he said.Abdullah’s statement contradicted what Ghani said about his former chief of staff on Sunday, who was being held for alleged embezzlement. Ghani said that his former chief of staff had fled the country and was still at large. But it also contradicted what his deputy, Abdul Raouf, who was seen driving the fugitive’s car, had said in his own interview with Radio Free Afghanistan.When Raouf, a longtime Ghani ally, asked about the whereabouts of Khalil Alikhil, the former deputy governor of the eastern province of Ghazni, he said it was “still not safe.”“There are still two or three people around the former governor, but they were captured during the battle and there is no security around them,” Raouf told Radio Free Afghanistan. He said the Afghan government was “not able to find anything” about Khalil Alikhil.Karzai said he would continue to insist that Ghani recognize the authority of the government and the High Council for National Reconciliation.“",

Many African Americans believe that natural hair is more natural, therefore more beautiful. For African Americans, natural hair has been a major sign of self-determination and self-respect.The video, created by the State Department's African American Affairs Division and directed by the National Museum of African American History and Culture, begins with the question: \"What does African American hair mean to you?\" and goes on to explain various aspects of African American hair, such as African American braids, afros, and natural hairstyles.The new commercial also features various African American celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, who recently made a documentary called \"Lupus\" about natural hair.Gwyneth Paltrow was quoted in the commercial as saying, \"Black Americans have such a proud history of natural hair and we need to continue to celebrate that.\"Paltrow said that Afro-dancers and afro-singers use \"natural hairstyles that we wear ourselves.\"The video also mentions the Afro-dance group Black Image, which was founded by a number of African-American musicians like Erykah Badu.Badu told the State Department's African American Affairs Division that African-American Afro-dance has \"the energy, the strength, the power, and the authenticity that Afro-dance has. It's one of the fastest growing forms of the movement.\"Black Image is \"one of the major forces pushing for change, from the grassroots to government officials, with a particular focus on social justice issues like police brutality, civil and human rights, and justice for the elderly.\"",

The lawsuit filed in Orange County alleges that more than 300 children in the Los Angeles Archdiocese may have been abused at the hands of Catholic priests over an 80-year span beginning in 1949.The lawsuit alleges that the dioceses, particularly in Southern California, covered up abusive priests by failing to keep accurate records of allegations of abuse and hiding documents about how the dioceses handled allegations. The plaintiffs allege that the dioceses allowed abusive priests to continue working within parishes and that they were also unwilling to deal with the victims and report cases of abuse.The allegations include that some dioceses allowed the abusive priests to continue working while they continued to be members of the community and kept church documents about allegations of abuse and attempts to cover up accusations from church officials.The lawsuits contend that the dioceses failed to investigate or protect the children who had been abused or did nothing about the records of abuse by abusing priests that they had already kept.\"These children have suffered the most grievous of injuries,\" according to the lawsuit, filed by two law firms, the National Child & Family Coalition in Sacramento and the Law Center for Children & Families in Los Angeles.The case seeks to force the Diocese of Orange to make public all records relating to claims of abuse against priests and to pay damages to all victims.The Orange Diocese denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday.\"While the Orange Diocese cannot, and will not, comment on the specific details of each case regarding which our priests are alleged to have abused children, we welcome the opportunity to examine the accusations,\" said Bishop John F.

It is not up for debate that there are millions of people who want [Trump] to be removed. It is also not up for debate that the election is not secure for him, in the same way that the UK, Spain, and France elections are secure,\" the source said.The UK's House of Commons, for instance, voted to formally accept Brexit, while Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez won a confidence vote.The United States, on the other hand, is one of the most secure countries in the world, the source added.On Thursday, the US Electoral College confirmed the election results and the Senate also confirmed them.As a result, President-elect Joe Biden will now be inaugurated to his second four-year term.

The United Nations has warned that over 100 000 voting papers and electronic devices have been destroyed and are yet to be retrieved.This is what is making it difficult for the Commission of Presidential Elections to declare a winner as it could be challenged by the losing candidate.On Tuesday, the Electoral Board of the CAR held a press briefing to address the issue, where several top members of the political parties addressed them. Some of them insisted that their party won and would win the elections.The electoral board, however, explained that the process in the country requires a complex computer software in order for the results to be transmitted from the central data banks to the electoral commission. The central banks hold over 10 000, 000 of these data sheets.\"It is expected that there will be an overwhelming response, hence the delay. The commission would work towards restoring confidence to the general public by addressing their grievances as soon as possible,” the EC said.The CARs presidential election has been suspended since mid-August due to alleged electoral fraud.

If consumer confidence stays this weak, it would be difficult for the economy to rebound,” said Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics.Consumers have been the main engine of economic growth so far this year. The weak retail sales come on the heels of a disappointing consumer spending reading last week. Analysts expected consumer spending to rise a mere 0.1 percent in October.U.S. stocks declined on Monday in reaction to the disappointing retail sales numbers, while bonds were trading with some upside momentum as the market digested the data. The stock market is down by roughly 1 percent over the last several days as investors fretted that economic growth will slow further without another financial stimulus effort.Retail sales can be a reliable indicator of consumer spending but are a lagging indicator because it doesn't always happen in the same month. The Federal Reserve will be looking closely at consumer spending figures when it meets on Dec. 14-15 to make an interest rate decision. The Fed has pledged to keep interest rates low to support the U.S. economic recovery.",

Many farmers are also facing increased labour costs from flooding the fields, which is forcing them to move to dryer regions like South Sudan or Nigeria.The country's planned mega-dam is called the Tuna Project, which will create an impoundment of almost 6,000 square kilometres (2,500 sq miles) upstream of the dam in the Nile basin.Egyptian officials say the project could create more jobs, particularly in its construction phase.But some say the project will exacerbate the country's food shortage.The Nile River originates in the East African continent, crosses the Middle East and reaches southern Africa. The river supplies water to over a dozen countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Sudan, South Africa and Ethiopia's main neighbor the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in the Blue Nile.Egyptian farmers rely on the Nile to irrigate their crops and supply households.Last year the country was hit by an extended drought, which meant crops such as maize had to be replanted due to the water shortage. As a result, Egypt saw food prices rise.\"The situation is very bad for us; we are going to spend a lot of money if we don't go to our fields and sell our crops,\" said Nasser El-Haddad, a rice farmer and member of the United Farmers' Movement, which is demanding that the construction of GERD be suspended.\"",

The Facility, which will be used to support the World Bank's work to stop the spread of the virus, can help mitigate the effects of the pandemic in a number of ways.The Emergency Response facility is a part of the multilateral development bank's $5.4 billion, 20-year COVID-19 Response and Recovery Plan, announced by the World Bank's president David Malpass in April 2020. The facility will be used by the UN Economic Commission for Western Asia (UNECWA), under its emergency response framework that will help to address the economic and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the region.The Emergency Response will support member countries' responses, such as building health services and providing basic livelihoods to combat the impact of the crisis. In addition, it will facilitate the acceleration of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts across the region.The Facility includes $5.4 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion. This will be used in a host of ways, including supporting Member States' response to the coronavirus pandemic and their transition to low-carbon and resilient development. In addition, the Facility will support Member States' capacity to adapt to climate impacts, including through their preparedness to respond to extreme weather and natural disasters in both the long-term and short term.The Facility will help mitigate the effects of the pandemic in the region, while ensuring that Member States' economies and livelihoods are not adversely affected, the World Bank said in a statement.The announcement by the World Bank was made in a letter to the UN Economic Commission for Western Asia from World Bank Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, in which she said that \"the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts have posed serious threats to development, particularly on women and girls. While the number of deaths and severe cases continues to increase, the recovery is largely limited to countries and regions where there is a well-established social safety net, including public health systems, affordable access to healthcare, and effective social programs.\"\"",

A BYD electric car was recently unveiled in the Chinese market.One of the biggest reasons for the Trump administration wanting to cut a deal with China on trade is that the president claims that the U.S. has \"little to gain\" from a trade deal with the Chinese and that the trade war is bad for the U.S. business community.U.S. President Donald Trump is currently in a trade war with China, which is also in the process of putting a tariff on another U.S. product: steel.Read the original article on CNBC.

She has spoken at length about her experiences as a child who is afflicted with Asperger’s, and the challenges that it poses for someone with a learning deficit to hold a job.I wish every Indian would become as unphased by the phrase “Asperger’s”, and “dyslexia”, as Shailja Patel has become by the term “mental illness” in our society.As a child, Shailja, and her sister, Shruti, were subjected to a very different set of experiences in their home. Shailja had a normal upbringing and a happy childhood. However, at an early age, the family realised that Shailja suffered from mental illness that manifested itself as an inability to process social events. Shruti could not do the same, as her brain, unlike that of Shailja’s, had a very high processing speed. Shruti was a gifted child, and went on to win the IAS exam and be the director of a prestigious government school. And Shailja, by her own admission, was the opposite.It has been a long process of acceptance in which Shruti and Shailja have learnt to live with their illnesses, with a higher degree of consciousness and a higher degree of comfort. Shruti’s battle with Asperger’s has helped Shailja accept, and to live with, the label of being mentally unwell.At the same time, Shruti has been taking advantage of the social acceptance, and the chance for her to work in the private sector. While Shailja is struggling with the mental illness, Shruti’s career is steadily rising.",

It is very valuable,\" he told Nyabagha.\"We are making an effort to make them aware of the importance of getting the best surgeons as early as possible to bring the best service to our patients,\" the surgeon said.Dr. Tereza, an orthopaedic surgeon from South Africa, said that she was very happy to see Rwanda's surgeons operating overseas and bringing reconstructive surgery to the citizens of the nation.\"",

The government will not prosecute Belkacem since his lack of guilt makes the prosecution inadmissible, because the trial would have to be delayed due to the need for additional evidence to be obtained.Belkacem’s detention was a political decision, according to the Interior Ministry, as the case had been dismissed after prosecutors failed to establish that Belkacem was involved in the attacks which occurred in Brussels, on November 19th, 2016.At the end of October, the Belgian parliament had suspended the trial of the suspect who had inspired the Brussels attacks. However, a week after the suspension of the trial of the Brussels attacker, the same Parliament, had decided to lift the suspension and hold another trial of the suspect who had inspired the Brussels attacks. The same decision was then made by the Belgian judiciary, the same people who suspended the Brussels terror trial and who were in control of the Brussels terrorism trial, without any explanation.Belkacem had reportedly been in contact with the Islamic State group (IS) but not directly with his group which did not take responsibility for the attacks which were planned to be carried out in Brussels but whose ultimate goal was to kill as many people as possible.Following the Belgian terror trial in July, 2016, which was suspended when the Belgian Parliament did not have enough evidence to justify the arrest of the Brussels suspect, the case against him was also dismissed as a result.",

U.S. officials have cautioned that Hamas, a radical Islamist organization that has ruled Gaza since 2006, could use the deal to cement control over the territory.

International Security has been a real issue for all countries in the world. Many governments and countries have been struggling to combat the terrorism threat both within their borders and internationally. The terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons, are of growing concern to many people of all nations. There is also a concern of terrorist attacks that would cause serious damage to the World Financial Systems. In 2002 there were reports of numerous attacks, especially in the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan that the United Nations believes were the work of terrorist groups. These attacks have been in order to create fear and create unrest within the populations of the affected countries. They also cause political unrest in the countries affected by these attacks. The terrorist attacks do not deter any nation from continuing to fight and keep the world safe. In this paper we will focus on the current terrorist threat and the possible consequences to the countries and governments in relation to it.A terrorist attack, in the form of a bomb, car bomb or other type of improvised explosive device (IED) was used against a diplomatic facility or military installation in a large city in an attempt to kill or injure an official or military personnel. The terrorists want to incite fear and confusion. They want the public to believe that there is a significant risk that officials and military personnel may be killed. The terrorism that targets the world’s financial systems are to make governments and the public fearful and to cause a financial panic. Terrorists do not care that the terrorist attacks are done for the sake of terrorism, they are trying to create fear and confusion that they believe will help bring about change in the nations that were targeted. In the United States a group of terrorist organizations carried out several attacks in the past. The most notable was the Oklahoma City bombing on April 17, 1995 and the 9/11 attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001. In the past year, there have been more than 30 bombings in cities throughout the United States.In the U.S. government, there have been several cases of FBI agents killed by a radical group known as the Black Liberation Army. This radical group is believed to be the group that launched the attacks on the U.S. embassies and other targets in Africa and the Middle East.",

On Tuesday, he issued a temporary nationwide stay on work on the Rio Grande Valley of Texas after a similar ruling in Arizona.Texas and Arizona argued that they needed the wall to protect against crime and drug smuggling.The judge said in his ruling that he did not think his order would result in the border being “virtually empty,” a conclusion that was contested by Texas officials.Moulton said he had to weigh whether he could keep the wall in place for the time being while the government appeals the case. It’s possible that the next hearing in the case will not be held in his courtroom.Moulton said he was concerned that parts of the wall would be built to look more like posts and less like the concrete sections of fencing that have been in place in places along the Mexican border.In April, Moulton ordered that parts of a border fence in eastern New Mexico must be taken down and that a new type of mesh barrier — one made of steel — be used. In his ruling Tuesday, Moulton stopped short of ordering the entire fence, but he noted that it could include some parts of it.Trump has pledged to construct 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to build new sections where existing walls fall short. Moulton’s decision makes it possible that some of the construction will be done in Texas, where new barriers are not permitted.",

        "text": "In the early days of Donald Trump's business life, he was mostly a real estate developer, with his real estate projects operating mostly in countries like Canada and Switzerland. But then he decided to use his connections as a real estate developer to help him get into politics with a \"Trump Organization\" and to build a presidential campaign that is currently embroiled in controversy.There are, of course, some caveats to this whole situation. Trump may not be as wealthy as he claims, and he has been accused of conflicts of interest with his business empire. But it's hard to deny that he's successfully built his brand around the idea of a Trump in the White House and a Trump presidency.Ivanka Trump has always been the president's daughter-in-law, but she has found her place in the White House not merely through serving as a political pawn, but by building the Trump brand and creating the political and financial benefits her family and business has found.While Trump is no longer in the public eye, the Trump family's business has remained in business and continues to grow.While the Trump family's business is still doing well, it has managed to avoid scandals like those involving her father, who was accused of mistreating women, or her brother, who was accused of taking money from foreign governments without their permission. This is largely thanks to the Trump brand, which is being built on the success and goodwill her family has managed to create with a loyal following.\"I know people think the Trump family is corrupt,\" Ivanka Trump said recently during a discussion about women and leadership with the Women's Business Council of New York City. \"I hope they believe that because the fact is the Trump family's businesses are doing really well. They are growing, and not just in the fashion industry.\"The New York Times reported in November 2017 that the Trump Organization, through Ivanka Trump's brand, was making a profit of $80 million in the first four quarters of 2017. Ivanka's father Donald Trump is still in office, but his son Eric and daughter Ivanka still manage the Trump brand. Donald Trump's sister, Mary Trump, is an administrator of the Trump Foundation.But it's unlikely that the Trump family's business will ever be as profitable as the Trump brand.",

And for two weeks now, the United States has been holding talks with Russian counterparts as well.Both sides have been looking for solutions to the crisis. But the talks have been held behind closed doors, and there are rumors that the United States has given up on its demand to get a peace deal by the end of April.So far there has been a lot of positive talk.

Two Taliban fighters also died in the attack, a senior security official said.In a statement, the Taliban said it had killed at least 27 security forces in the attack in Waziristan.Two people were killed and 40 injured in attacks carried out by the Taliban in South Waziristan, police said.The Taliban claimed responsibility for at least five attacks that targeted police across South Waziristan province in the past few days, but it was not clear if any of the militants involved was from the group.",

Bush.Obama’s four years have seen a steady recovery in the U.S. economy and the decline of terrorism.A report released today by the Federal Reserve says the U.S. has regained its manufacturing-driven growth following a recession that started in December 2007 and was only officially declared over in June 2009.The report notes that the nation had added 2.7 million private sector jobs since 2007 and a further 1.6 million in 2012.The economy is now experiencing a second period of recovery.“All indications are that this recovery continues to be strong and that it will become a virtuous circle,” President Obama said.President Obama also signed eight executive orders during his first 100 days in office. Among them:“We will continue to invest in science, in infrastructure. We will make sure that every child in America gets a decent education, and that every single child can succeed in this country.”“We’ll make sure that every American has access to affordable health insurance, and that every American can afford the prescription drugs they need, and that every American has access to quality, affordable college education.”“",

Some of them fear they are moving toward illiberalism and may become more difficult to control.The new populist, illiberal Europe is beginning to resemble the US and Western Europe of the 1930s, but without the economic and political stability. Europe’s leaders may finally be listening.One of the key elements of illiberalism is the use of the legal system to prevent people from exercising democracy. It may be seen as the new tyranny of the masses. In the United States during the 1920s, popular movements like the League of Labor forced the government to provide better civil rights, and helped turn the nation from a conservative to a progressive nation. It is often thought that the Great Depression was caused by the excesses of the New Deal. In Europe, illiberal governments were able to take advantage of the economic dislocation of the Great Depression to prevent political debate on important issues.In the last three years, Europe’s populist and illiberal movements have moved beyond the traditional boundaries of traditional political alliances. Now they are challenging not only the traditional parties but also the political institutions of the European Union.For example, European leaders reacted furiously to a recent report from French President Emmanuel Macron, who made a speech to an audience of the European Parliament denouncing racism and anti-Semitism in Europe. Macron, a former investment banker, is making an attempt to rebrand the movement’s aims by portraying himself as a champion of liberal values. He is right: his report found that many of Europe’s anti-immigrant parties were led by individuals with questionable or even dubious backgrounds and many of them shared little if any of Europe’s liberal values.",

        "text": "A new study by the Armed Conflict Project has revealed a key role played by traditional systems for conflict resolution in the troubled Middle East: the 'tribal system.'The study, published in The Lancet, reports that it is tribes in the Middle East who are best able to engage in conflict resolution. The study explains that the tribes are often more engaged, and more committed, to finding a resolution than are government officials.The analysis, based on interviews with local tribes, also found that in some instances, individuals were willing to kill each other to make a peace agreement, with tribal elders able to be relied upon to assist this work.In a recent speech to the American Institute for International Studies in Washington, D.C., U.S. President Barack Obama said,\"A lot of things that have happened in the United States over the last couple decades, particularly in the post-Cold War era, can be traced back to a failure to recognize and honor a tradition of cooperation among our people—a tradition of the collective defense in times of conflict. And as a nation, we're not even really doing that today, and it's not just in places where we've engaged in civil wars; our policies toward the Iraqi people are a good example.\"There are four possible forms of the tribal system. They range from traditional tribal leadership to an elaborate form of central government with a military, police, and police agencies and courts.In Yemen's conflict, tribal leaders are often in control of the military and security sectors, and have power through the ability to exert influence through their influence within central authorities.In Afghanistan, there is a tradition of tribalism associated with political authority among men of one tribe that has a different form in other areas. For example, Afghan tribes are mostly tribal leaders, with the exception of a few prominent women.Another tradition in Arab countries that is common in the Middle East is the \"tribal system,\" which encompasses the leadership of the political class and military. According to the report, the leader of the most influential tribe in Yemen, Abu Israil, is also a tribal leader, and tribal leaders are also involved in political decision-making, as the leaders and the political system tend to dole out power based on tribal lines.The research team notes that the 'tribal system' can be effective in a conflict. It can allow people to avoid killing each other, and thus avoid major humanitarian suffering.",

He said the vessels had conducted drills with the Philippine Coast Guard.Tensions between the two neighbors rose with several skirmishes this year, including the arrest of a Chinese sailor, a Filipino crew member of the Chinese fishing vessel, and a Filipino navy officer who was on his way back to the Philippines when the incident occurred.China denied the allegations, saying it was taking a necessary action in response to a provocation. China did not respond to questions from a Philippine foreign ministry official after the drills.The maneuvers came on a holiday in the Philippines when Chinese fishing boats normally have no trouble operating in the contested waters. The Philippines has been trying to push back more than a dozen Chinese fishing boats that repeatedly enter its waters for search-and-rescue operations.The U.S. government has accused China of deploying at least five vessels near the Philippine naval base in the Spratly Islands, and at least one of them fired warning shots at a Philippine vessel in international waters last month.China responded that it fired only warning shots to prevent a collision, and denied it sent any boats into Filipino waters.China claims almost all the South China Sea, though Manila claims nearly all the waters.",

Dhaka residents say his father, also named as Chowdhury, was one of those killed.While many Bangladeshis have openly talked about losing relatives to religious violence – such as the 1982 massacre that drove hundreds of thousands from India’s eastern border – few have shared experiences in the same way.“I know many people who have lost people, but I think they keep it inside and don’t talk about it,” said Zareed Rahman, a Dhaka resident and a former politician.In a recent interview on Bangladesh’s TV, he said that his uncle was killed in 1990. “He was a priest, but he was also killed. I remember his face. You can see his face and hair,” Rahman said, recounting his uncle’s fate as the priest.“I always keep the incident inside and keep it away from my family,” he told the anchor on Friday, and then asked “when are we going to face Islamic extremism and terrorism?”The interview prompted a flood of questions on how Bangladeshis could protect themselves, and on the country’s “soft” image and how such killings could harm the country.“No one should be afraid of Bangladesh,” said the anchor. “Let’s bring out the best in each other.”The anchor also expressed optimism about Bangladesh’s chances of becoming a leader in the regional peace dialogue, something Rahman hoped would happen as soon as possible.But while the anchors’ hope appears to be tempered by the reality, many Bangladeshis – including ordinary, law-abiding citizens – are now openly talking about their experience of violence from religion and extremism, despite the country’s strong tradition of tolerance, respect for civil liberties and an independent judiciary.“",

Some college-bound students chose to attend a \"better\" school because they could get a better education.But now that some schools have taken steps to ease the path for paying off student loans, things are getting a little strange.According to CNBC, now that a law has been passed to allow students to \"refinance\" their student loans, schools are starting to take an increasingly hands-on approach in making sure that all students are paying their loans every day, even if they fail to complete classes. That includes offering students a \"free\" college education from the schools in their home states.But as the law is changing, schools are starting to create more complicated programs for the families of college-bound students. These kids are being forced out of their home states so that their families can attend institutions of higher education, even if they don't really need to attend because the schools in their states are so much better than the ones they'd have to attend to attend to them.The latest controversy arose in Utah, where one of the schools is offering this type of tuition-reduction package to parents of students who don't make it into the schools they want:Under the program, if a student does not graduate from at least one of the schools that meet the criteria, their parents are automatically enrolled in the program and receive tuition remission, but they will still need to work to cover the costs of attending the schools.\"I don't want to go to Utah now, I really don't, but they've got a program that they think it might be best for our daughter,\" said Laura Wilson, the mother of a high school student.\"",

But since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in April, U.S. military strategy has changed. It has shifted toward countering the Taliban, especially in the south.In a video released last week by Army Maj. Gen.

The agency estimates that more than 200 million Americans take medications that come with sodium.“It is our hope that these voluntary standards will provide the flexibility for manufacturers and producers to determine a consistent approach in meeting the requirements of the voluntary standards,” says FDA Commissioner David Kessler. “And our hope is that these standards will be used to help create a healthier food environment.”",

He reiterated his statement regarding migrants and asylum seekers in an interview that was aired on Monday's program of Bulgaria's Channel 1.\"I am not trying to be on the same page as the Greek, Italian or Bulgarian policy, or any of the other policies that are in favour of those arriving, and those fleeing,\" he said.He continued, \"I am calling to be open-minded.

In January it received a US$12 million grant, down $6 million from the previous year.The agency faces stiff competition from other international non-governmental organizations that are operating on more substantial and often more generous funding streams.The number of people who were forcibly displaced during the July violence alone increased by 100 percent, according to UNRWA estimates, and the agency said the number of internally displaced could double if the fighting spreads outside the Gaza Strip.But the UNRWA chief insisted that the agency has been taking steps to expand its efforts to help the displaced.\"We are now operating in refugee camps and assisting those in need,\" Krahenbuhl said.But while UNRWA and other UN agencies have received vital contributions from the West and the Arab states, the flow of international donations has been extremely limited so far, a result of the \"conflict and instability in the region\" and the conflict's \"humanitarian implications.\"\"We have been able to secure our own assistance in some cases,\" Krahenbuhl said, but \"there is no guarantee that these donors will be able to sustain this or come back for more.\"The chief of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, last week suggested that the Palestinian Authority could help pay some of the costs.

The Bambari site has been used repeatedly in recent years as a location for ADF activities, and is used as a staging ground for joint operations against the armed group.During the night of 7 October, the witnesses reported hearing bursts from the town, and saw Chadian military vehicles coming to the area. They reported that at around the same time, several people were wounded in the town. The residents told them that the soldiers were from the Chadian 8th Division. Later that morning, at around 9 a.m., they learned that Chadian troops had killed five civilians, including a five-year-old, and also that several people had been seriously wounded.Two sources were also confirmed to have died during the attack.The Chadian soldiers allegedly began shooting into the crowd in an attempt to kill the men. The witnesses also said that their men opened fire after the Chadian soldiers were told by the local Chadian population that the local population had attacked their bases.According to the report, Chadian soldiers were in the town for an assessment. Chadian personnel were not the intended target of Operation Barkhane, and troops were not sent to Bambari specifically to defend it against any ADF action.Chadian authorities have denied allegations of killings in the town, saying that they had taken over four thousand fighters away from the area.",

They made the robotic arm using \"a special 3-D printing technique.\" That arm can also grasp objects at a distance of eight feet, which was not possible previously.The arm, called the LAMMION, was created using a three-dimensional (3D) printer developed by University of Toronto's School of Engineering.The robotic arm features three degrees of freedom, enabling it to lift a 3-D object weighing about 4 kilograms (9.9 pounds) with a 20-gram (0.8 ounces) weight ratio. To move the arm in the direction desired by its operator, it requires four degrees of freedom.The LAMMION is the first three-dimensional (3D) robot arm to perform a basic movement (i.e. picking up a 2-D object). This is a significant advancement in the engineering world as the first use of a robotic arm without requiring additional hardware such as sensors, motors, actuators, and so on to achieve this task.The project involves developing algorithms to automatically transfer the information from the LAMMION to a remote control system. It also includes the development of a \"robot arm extender.\" This is a small external device, such as a carabiner, designed to be affixed to the robotic arm extension to make it longer and to hold objects at a greater height.The technology and research that is being developed in this project is being applied to other projects and is likely to be used to improve human robot interfaces for various tasks.Researchers and students from the UCF Faculty of Technology are working on various projects.",

It feels like a national tragedy, the likes of which we never even expected.There is no greater illustration than the reaction from people and the government.It has been a huge and overwhelming effort to combat this global threat. While the numbers are staggering and many people, businesses and organisations have fallen on hard times, some people have responded to the crisis with incredible kindness and generosity.From small donations of food and money to the most heartfelt pleas for volunteers, to donations to food banks, to help with medical costs and for personal protective equipment, the reaction has been immense and deeply moving.It also highlights how people are feeling and reacting to all this in different ways. It is almost as if some people are doing it as a social duty to give back, whilst some are just doing it because they want to feel part of the response in some way.The government has also offered a huge response, a huge and overwhelming amount of money to help fight the disease.

He also called for an independent judicial investigation into allegations that Syrian armed groups are preventing aid access to civilians.The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) is conducting operations against rebel forces in the province of Quneitra, which borders Turkey.The battle for the city of Tamer al-Dah is raging between SAA and armed groups led by Jaish al-Islam, a militant group based in northeastern Syria.Despite a number of offensive operations by the SAA, Jaish al-Islam continues to hold control of areas around Tamer al-Dah.Brahimi said that in the last month alone, approximately 200,000 people have fled their homes of Quneitra.UN experts say they have collected evidence that Syrian and allied forces have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the assault on the city of Tabuk.Brahimi said that the United Nations was \"deeply disturbed and concerned\" by reports that members of Jaish al-Islam have been using excessive force against civilians in the area of Al-Sukhanat as well as using artillery and air strikes at will to attack and bomb areas of Tamer al-Dah.\"",

The first of the year, and the second awarded by HumanKind, compels you to spend some time on this site, then to post an online question “about yourself.” You need to think hard about what you are doing and what you want to achieve before you leave this page. The purpose is to help people get to know you, and to give you some insight into who you are and what you want to accomplish. You may be asked to elaborate, but you can say you already know who you want to be about yourself, that you already have some good ideas about what you want to do. You can give yourself some good advice. You may be asked to explain why you do your current work and what you are trying to do. Perhaps you can tell people what you have learned about yourself, or what you have learned from the people you have come into contact with. I hope, by writing this, I can answer your questions about yourself and make yourself seem more of a “person” than a “gimmick,” and a “pseudoperson.”The second Compassionate Care Award Award for the year, a few days before I was told by HumanKind that I could ask any “organization, charity or organization” to write me about myself, is supposed to be a “test.” What does that mean? I want to see what is really behind what I am doing and what I say. This is to help me see how far my “passive” self has “passive” feelings and a “passive” character that “passive” feelings don’t have. It isn’t necessarily that I am asking you to tell me what is going on in your life, but it does allow me to learn from what you write, and from what I write about you. This kind of “test” doesn’t tell you who you are, because you don’t write about a “you” and tell a “me” of who you want to be.",

Surya, founder of an NGO called ODF, or Odisha Disaster Forum.Many cyclone survivors in Odisha have no access to banking facilities, no land registry, and no government-owned mobile phone network because most areas are cut off by inaccessible mountains, Surya told AFP.“",

A 2010 study from the University of California-Santa Barbara and the National Center for Educational Statistics found that in some Native American communities, the risk of violent crime was 10 times greater than in communities where only 20 percent of residents are Native American.While the criminal justice reform movement has made a dent in reducing violent crime rates overall, Native American women’s safety remains a serious concern. To remedy that, law enforcement agencies and tribal leaders need to address the unique challenges Native American women face and ensure that crime victims receive the protection they deserve.According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Native American women were the victims of crimes at four times the rate of white women. In California, Native American women are 3.5 times as likely to be arrested for crimes as white women, and are 1.7 times as likely to be victims of violence.A 2007 study from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that while violent crime rates decreased in communities where Native American women were the primary victim group, their rates of robbery continued to be higher than in communities where more than half of residents were Native American.",

This request was submitted as a statement of Nigeria's intention to take action against atrocities by Boko Haram. Nigeria's actions are in response to a letter of request sent to the ICC by the U.S. State Department in 2014.Amnesty International's request for action against crimes committed by Boko Haram is an important step in the ongoing struggle to end crimes against humanity perpetrated by Boko Haram.Boko Haram is responsible for committing atrocities on a horrific scale against civilians in Nigeria's Sambisa Forest, where over 250,000 people were displaced and some 300,000 people have fled their homes. The Sambisa Forest has been declared as a humanitarian crisis because its nature, scale and magnitude of destruction make it difficult to provide food for all displaced people in need.The Sambisa Forest has been subjected to extensive destruction, including the destruction of more than half a million trees and a significant number of animal farms in order to ensure Boko Haram's operational activities.Amnesty International is concerned that it is now increasingly clear that many of these crimes were committed at the hands of armed groups who use the forest to carry out their operations and have caused serious humanitarian concern for the people living in and near the forest.The situation calls for a full investigation into these crimes, which would enable full accountability and accountability for those responsible. The United States of America also needs to take action to ensure that the crimes committed by these armed groups are fully investigated and properly punished.Boko Haram's brutal persecution of thousands of people for the crime of trying to leave the Sambisa Forest and return to their homes, is an urgent humanitarian issue in need of urgent attention. This attack should serve as a call for an international investigation into the Sambisa Forest crimes committed by Boko Haram and a call to the ICC to prosecute war criminals.In a letter to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on 2 December 2017, Nigeria's Justice Minister, and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, confirmed Nigeria's intention to take action against atrocities committed by Boko Haram.It is now time for the ICC to initiate an investigation and to fully investigate the crimes committed in Sambisa Forest.",

        "text": "By James M. DorseyNEW DELHI — Despite the economy slowing further, India is again raising interest rates to try to rein in inflation.The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee, on Tuesday, unanimously voted to raise the benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage point to 7.15 percent for six months, and another 0.05 percentage point to 7.20 percent for nine months.This will be the 12th hike since September, but will be the second since November. It is the first since August, and would mark the first increase in the benchmark interest rate since India began its current rate-hike cycle in November last year.The decision has become increasingly controversial within the government, and some economists say it may signal that there will be no need for further increases this year. Inflation in India has been above the RBI's estimate since September, reaching 7.23 percent last month — an increase from 6.78 percent in August.India's growth rate, now about 6 percent — from 5.5 percent — is expected to decline to 6.1 percent or so by the end of the year.Analysts say there is some possibility of some room for further easing as more recent data, particularly the growth rate of rural areas, have been strong. But the overall direction of policy remains clear: the central bank is determined to try to reverse the recent slump in inflation, a feat it has accomplished only once before: by raising interest rates to a record high of 8.5 percent in July 2011.India has suffered a decade of weak economic growth as a result of an ongoing recession stemming from foreign direct investments, which have left the country's manufacturing sector stagnant and dependent on exports and, by extension, remittances. Even after the RBI cut interest rates in 2012, the economy still suffered from a deficit.Last year, the central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point, but the economy had already weakened significantly. India's economic growth rate of 5.9 percent in 2011 had not been seen since 1984, when the GDP shrank by 1.6 percent.The current slowdown is mostly due to the fall in global demand, which is likely to improve in the near future, and higher interest rates.",

According to the report, the ministry is still considering the plans.The report states that Turkey does not follow Islamic laws and has many cultural laws that are separate from Islam. Therefore, the country follows different rules and laws than it does the religion of Islam.The report also said that a law, which calls for the expulsion of all students from religious schools, was submitted to the education ministry in 2011. The law states that there has to be an increase in the proportion of students from religious backgrounds in private schools.Turkish law states that all religious schools in the country have to comply with the standards of the Turkish education system, which is also an Islamic system.

This is compared to the global figure of 15 per cent.In addition, 60 per cent of West African schools (38.3 million students) were under-resourced with insufficient funding for education and health, compared to the global figure of 20 per cent.The report also found that West African schools had poor environmental conditions and sanitation, as well as poor environmental conditions in schools themselves and in the environments of the surrounding communities.The report concludes that it would be possible to close almost half (47.5 per cent) of the schools in the area, with only 4.1 per cent (8.9 million students) remaining open.This would mean, in theory, that every high school would be closed, and nearly 1.5 million young people would be able to leave the region for good. But it would also mean a huge economic decline and joblessness in a region that has experienced huge growth since the early 2000s.The total cost of the school system was estimated at $2,300 per student, but many schools in the region already have high operating costs.The report suggests that the region would have to raise the $3 billion the report says it needs to properly improve the school systems, rather than just closing them, if the region wants to achieve full economic development.",

But the policy is likely to be extended until the next national election in 2021 because voter discontent still deepens as economic gains fade.Japanese voters have increasingly taken issue with Abe, who is on his third term as prime minister, due to his handling of the economic crisis stemming from the Fukushima nuclear accident.Fears that he might quit at the end of his first term have never materialized, but this year they could take a more decisive turn after a series of political setbacks and poor economic forecasts.Abe last month suffered a second blow after a string of major setbacks including a failed constitutional amendment, a government reshuffle and a lower house election called by the opposition.Abe's ruling bloc is facing a similar situation to that of the opposition during the last three decades, when powerful military and foreign governments sought to block any progress made by the prime minister during a period of relative political stability, forcing Abe to push to quickly solve problems.The ruling bloc is looking to hold on to power next year.\"We'll do our utmost to secure a stable Japan,\" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday, adding that the government was committed to Abe's second term.Analysts believe that the opposition will refrain from trying to force Abe from office.Abe's top priority in the run-up to the election will be deciding which of the six parties that are represented in the Diet -- including those from the major opposition parties -- will run for the top post.The ruling bloc has a simple majority in the upper house of parliament, but it relies on a support of at least 200 seats in the lower house to secure a majority.

The current debt is more than three times the GDP of Thailand's neighbors - Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam - all of whom are in the same precarious position as the nation of Thailand in that they are highly indebted and are facing severe economic problems.A major political move is expected this month to address Thailand's debt problem, but Somphachai said it would not be an immediate move that might increase the cost of borrowing.",

The crash site was also not the usual spot for the type of bird that flew over the Hudson River, though a pilot said they saw them near that area in a video from his aircraft.A pilot who was taking the same flight was also seen by eyewitnesses.The incident caused a large influx of geese to the area, including one that caused the crash of the aircraft, according to investigators.Experts have previously suggested that Canadian geese become aggressive when approached by humans in a similar fashion to their American counterparts.The crash of a small plane in 2015, which killed two people, happened just miles from the crash of a Canadian passenger jet near the same area. The incident is currently being investigated by the Canadian aviation agency, according to officials.The Canadian government is not ruling out the possibility that the birds in that area were to blame for the crash, but they are not certain if it was the same bird. The crash site was also too deep to be identified, so the Canadian government is not able to find the body it is trying to ID, an aviation expert said.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are also investigating the incident.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The doctors say their pay is too low.The president's warning followed a government decision to impose a nationwide lockdown that began on Friday to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\"No one is in a better position to judge your attitude in terms of being able to fight the corona crisis than the president himself,\" said Robert Mugabe, who heads Zimbabwe's ruling party.The government imposed the lockdown after more than 300 people attended a private funeral — one of several events that have been linked to the coronavirus — at a mosque in Harare's affluent Mvura suburb.The government ordered people attending funerals to wear masks and to be confined to their homes for 14 days following the funeral.On Saturday, more than 100 doctors and nurses who had staged strikes for better pay staged another protest at one of Zimbabwe's largest state hospitals in Harare's capital, demanding better working conditions and their salaries should be increased to $100 ($0.01 per hour), which they say is below the poverty line.\"The current pay levels at some state hospitals are insufficient to care for our patients,\" said doctor James Sanyang. \"It is in this regard that we would like to express our strong displeasure in the face of the employer.\"",

The country did not report any new cases in 2020.“The country has performed extremely well over the last 10 years,” said Dr. Dileep Nangula, WHO’s assistant director-general for immunization.The Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, began vaccinating its people in 2017, but the number of confirmed cases has fallen sharply as a result of a “concerted national immunization campaign.”",

For example, hurricanes are more powerful and wetter because global warming is leading to wetter and more volatile seas.\"The longer the warm-air circulation over the ocean goes on, the more water is going to be evaporated into the air and the more water is going to be absorbed by the atmosphere,\" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, via USA Today.

The U.S. is expected to spend as much on green energy in the next two decades as the entire budget of France in the 20th century.\"It's kind of a no-brainer in my mind, really.

It said that Vance asked for the financial records to “better understand” how Trump invested, and the president’s lawyers called that request a “misuse of process” that they would oppose.“The president’s efforts to obstruct this investigation should be resisted,” the lawyers added. “His efforts to interfere with this investigation are unprecedented and, if left unchecked, threaten to undermine the rule of law.”Trump is embroiled in a legal battle with two women who say he sexually assaulted them. A federal appeals court has refused to overrule a judge’s order that compelled Trump to give his tax returns to prosecutors.Trump, a Republican, has argued that the tax returns have nothing to do with the two women, one of whom says she had an affair with Trump years before the alleged assault.There is no question that Trump’s personal financial dealings are a central topic of the investigation.",

As the land gets smaller, farmers and ranchers increasingly rely on truckers to transport their products to market, thus driving up food prices throughout the nation. A recent truck strike in the Amazon state of Roraima, the biggest producer of soybeans in Brazil, sparked fears that the agrarian reform—a keystone of President Michel Temer's 2017 election campaign—could spiral out of control. But the union representing truckers has rejected the call for an indefinite strike by workers. The truck drivers are demanding an increase in compensation, as well as increased payments to workers on the country's food network. For them, it is just as much a question of survival as it is an election issue. They are also fighting corruption accusations lodged against the federal government and Temer.For truckers, it is a question of survival as much as it is an election issue.In the face of this threat, President Temer has begun reallocating cash to compensate the truck drivers—a controversial move that infuriates farmers and ranchers. The federal government, meanwhile, has pledged billions in tax incentives aimed at strengthening the local farming industry, such as grants, tax relief and credit for the payment of workers on the food network. The government also plans to increase the number of farmers and food producers on the agricultural labor force, particularly in Roraima state. These measures have largely proven effective to strengthen the agriculture sector, which in recent years has begun to generate a steady revenue stream that will allow the farmers to meet the needs of consumers.",

The two presidents, both of whom have served as vice presidents, have come under fire from some of the country's military leaders for what they consider inadequate action in pursuing peace agreements with the transitional government in South Sudan and rebels in northern Sudan.State Department officials, who have been in Khartoum in recent days to brief top South Sudanese officials and to facilitate an official South Sudan-South Sudanese summit meeting, said they were still finalizing details and had no additional details to share. They said that no time frame for the meeting had been determined.The State Department officials said that the three-hour meeting would be a first for the United States in the two countries since the creation of South Sudan in July 2011.The officials said that they could not provide further information on the possible purpose of the meeting because that would jeopardize the security of U.S. officials.They said that the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan would meet at a time of greater stability and stability for the region, the three-day Sudan-South Sudan summit meeting being held in Khartoum this week.

In an exclusive interview, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the general officer commanding U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, discusses the increased possibility of attacks against American or coalition troops.With growing political pressure on President Barack Obama, there are signs that McChrystal may be pressured to move away from the Afghan strategy that has been put in place for the past five years by U.S. President George W. Bush.McChrystal acknowledges that, even with new troop numbers coming into Afghanistan, the pace of attacks against U.S. and coalition forces there has not slowed down.\"You do realize that every day that goes by with us operating against more and more of this enemy — more of the enemy's ability to operate, to launch attacks — means that that is more of an ever-present threat for the next year or two or three,\" McChrystal said. \"So the military remains concerned about the threat, and they continue to assess what the best strategy of combat remains against a higher degree of threats.\"In January 2010, McChrystal and Defense Secretary Robert Gates released the report \"Sustainability: The United States' Strategy to End the Afghan War,\" which outlined a strategy for ending the nearly 18-year long war in Afghanistan.Some have criticized McChrystal and the Obama administration for \"releasing a report that doesn't reflect the reality on the ground in Afghanistan,\" and some experts have called for withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some have also questioned the rationale for keeping troops in Afghanistan, which includes preventing a resurgence of al Qaeda.McChrystal insists that there is a \"real risk\" from what he calls the \"new generation\" of the Taliban. But he and the other senior commanders have also cautioned against a wholesale withdrawal.\"We're looking at the broader security threat of the Taliban to do our part [in preventing a resurgence of al Qaeda] by reducing that threat in the larger regional context and giving the political leadership that has to contend with that issue,\" he said. \"We're not going to be the sole provider of that threat. We're going to play that role in a larger regional context of the threat.\"",

The approved plan is in the shape of a five-year master plan of expanding Jewish presence in the area.Barak originally announced that the plan would be implemented at the beginning of 2005, but the plan was finally approved by Ehud Olmert, now Israel’s Prime Minister. In order to build the plan, the population growth of the Israeli population should increase, the Jewish population should increase and Israel should increase the size of the area which already houses the Palestinians of East Jerusalem to 200,000.At a time when the Palestinian population is in decline due to an Israeli blockade, the Israeli government decided to create its own solution in order to “balance” the demographic and demographic trends. The Israeli government would have the aim to increase the Jewish population to 60,000 by 2014. In order to achieve this goal, the Israeli government will have to create approximately 700,000 housing units in East Jerusalem.

The advancement of technology is making it easier to create fashion wear and products which have already been incorporated in some of the leading brands. For instance, in 2015, Apple introduced the Apple Watch which is a popular technology based wear. The watch is equipped with different sensors which enable the users to monitor a lot of data about themselves. For example, the watch can send a message when the user is running out of time. There are apps available which are installed on the Apple Watch which can make the user stay connected with them anytime anywhere. Similarly, the smart watch can detect the temperature and can be adjusted according to the body’s needs. The watch can control the music and make call so that the user gets more information than can be communicated with human voice. These devices make fashion wear available in an even more sophisticated manner.The trend of using technology in fashion is also increasing as more consumers prefer to shop online. A study in 2016 reveals that almost 80% of all people today use computers to buy fashion and they also use technology to access their personal information. These devices enable the customers to stay connected with the brands they like.For instance, the Amazon app for android users, is a very popular application which enables the user to buy anything from Amazon.com even though not a huge number of people use this application for the purpose.The latest fashion trends also incorporate technology in their designs. In some cases, there is no visible change in the design but in some cases, there are changes happening. For example, an electronic wrist band such as an Apple Watch can be used to provide information about the wearer. Similar technology can be incorporated in the latest designs.With technology becoming more mainstream in fashion, consumers are not only consuming the latest trends but also buying them.In 2016, there were more than 70 million wearable devices that were sold. Some of these wearables even run software which controls the device. These electronic devices are becoming more and more popular.For instance, in 2013, a new Apple Watch was launched in order to provide an even more advanced level of functionality. This watch is able to collect data from the wearer and also be used to make calls and send text messages.The future of fashion is certainly going to be a lot of interesting developments involving technology and design.",

The resolution calls for a military pullback by Tuesday from Iraq, but it does not call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops.The resolution has many advantages for both the Bush administration and for Bush and Cheney. For one, it will give the Bush administration more time to push its war plans in the Security Council, a move that might be opposed by the United States, China, or Russia, though both of those countries are bound by the same rules. For two, Bush and Cheney can now say that the Security Council has endorsed a military plan. The resolution also will give Bush and Cheney plausible deniability for the lack of action against Saddam Hussein, something that both administrations have attempted to use as an argument for action.The final version of the resolution, however, makes several concessions to the Iraqi government. The Security Council asks that Iraq produce, in five months, sufficient quantities of fuel for the country’s two largest cities and provide information on the arms it has stockpiled. It also asks that the Iraqi government not use the “fierce fighting and heavy fighting” of the war against the U.S.-led coalition. The Iraqi government can then appeal to the Security Council if it feels that it should have that right.The resolution also asks that U.N. troops in the country do not face any civilian casualties while carrying out the mission, that the UN military presence in Iraq be cut by half by December 1, and that U.N. military personnel operating within the country to protect civilian populations should remain until the end of the year.The resolution also asks the United States to provide all necessary logistics to the Iraqi government.",

Most notable has been the case of the Lebanese startup of Echos Digital Media.Lebanese startups have been part of social initiatives in different ways, starting with a local nonprofit that helped the poor get mobile phones for them, then with a charitable charity that provides water.While there is obviously an element of profit-making involved in some of the ideas, the idea of starting a business in a country like Lebanon involves far more than just making a quick buck.It is not surprising that some of the first and most successful entrepreneurs here come from the communities that they are trying to impact.For the new arrivals to Lebanon, and all of those already here, it can be challenging to navigate the startup world. There are many great resources to get an idea started, but the hard part is getting it funded. There are also a lot of things that you might want to know that you don’t realize you need or can’t afford to do yourself or the startup doesn’t need to pay you to do it.Lebanon, like many countries around the globe is suffering a financial crisis and is trying to fix it one piece of the puzzle at a time. In many of the developing countries, the government’s only interest is in ensuring that the companies and industries are creating the jobs that they can’t hire locally.However, in some cases, the companies have to spend more money than they would like, or the companies have to invest even more money to try to create jobs, not just the people that are employed in their businesses.",

Some said their action was retaliation for the decision of the top court to reduce the salary of teachers by half during one of the biggest waves of anti-government protests in the country’s history.The protesters chanted the term “el hombre al que esta perdido,” or “the man who fell asleep” in reference to the five Supreme Court justices.“I want you to understand this,” Venezuelan lawyer Edgar Zambrano said in video filmed by the prosecutor. “This is not a joke. You and your fellow magistrates were complicit in the killing of two people, in the face of international support.

The two have already been cleared of all charges.But there is a lot more at stake for the people of the European continent, which is not the only European community in Europe with a population of former colonies and former people of the continent.Some countries and regions in Europe are very close to the borders with their former colonies and former people.“The countries and regions in which there is a substantial minority presence are very concerned about this issue, because it is something which really impacts their daily life,” an official at the European Parliament told Euronews.The official spoke anonymously.“",

(File Image)BANGKOK, Thailand, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's win in a general election on Sunday could trigger a power struggle within the ruling alliance that could split the main opposition parties, analysts said.Prayuth's election victory has raised hopes among his supporters of restoring Thai democracy, but those hopes could also lead to conflict between his two main rival parties, the Future Forward party led by former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, and an opposition alliance led by former Deputy PM Prasit Doophanop, both of whom have said they are prepared to sit together in a new Thai-led government.Prayuth's party won 35% of the vote, just shy of the 38% needed for a simple majority in parliament and a parliamentary majority to enact laws, but both the Future Forward and Prasit parties have been under pressure to sit together in a new government after both parties won more than 10% of the vote in a separate national survey.But Prasit and Future Forward, whose supporters have demanded an immediate power-sharing agreement, have so far stuck with their pledge of holding \"pre-vote consultations\" to discuss which party or candidates to support in future elections.Future Forward said in a statement it was prepared to \"agree or disagree\" with any political party, but said it would not sit with a \"fascist regime\" and urged the public to rally on Sunday in support of the party and the government.\"If Prayuth's party is accepted by both Prasit's party and Future Forward's party in a government, the future is very bright,\" said Somsak Setboonach, political science lecturer at Thammasat University.\"However, this will be difficult if the Future Forward party and Prasit's party fail to work together as one government, as both parties will have different interests and views on future politics.\"Thammasat University Political Science Professor Chotisol Tatsirasri said that Prasit and Future Forward had similar aims and would work for an independent administration in a post-war Thailand.But he added that the two parties had different strategies to achieve the goal.\"",

Starr was the lead vocalist for most of the songs on the album.Postcards is a collection of new songs including a reworking of a song called, \"I Don’t Worry Anymore.\" Starr and McCartney met at a concert at The Big Garden in Greenwich Village in 1962. McCartney and Starr were married for 15 years and have three children together. Starr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 1999 and his music has been widely featured in the movies and TV shows.The band who originally performed the song, The Four Tops, has recorded it themselves, and The Stils are recording a version as well. A TV studio was recorded the song with the four Tops singing it and Starr singing it on the album.After the album was released in November, a reworked version of the song, \"Sgt.

Starr had played the song at the ceremony as well. The version with the Stils singing the song was also played at the ceremony, but only because the Starr version could not be played due to copyright violations. The song was played as a highlight of the tribute concert, and the entire song was played.The original version of the song was recorded in 1964 at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Chicago where The Stils and the Beatles were at the time.

Immelt has been at the helm of the conglomerate for 16 years, overseeing a transformation that included selling many of the company's units. Over that time, General Electric sold its insurance, credit card, plastics and security divisions. It also invested more heavily in new technologies, including a recent $1.65 billion acquisition of LM Wind Power, a Denmark-based manufacturer of rotor blades for wind turbines. Flannery is a longtime General Electric executive, starting his career at GE Capital in 1987.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

A referendum for independence from Indonesia set off a wave of violence by anti-independence militias that left the small island territory a blackened, smoldering ruin.After two and one-half years under United Nations administration, East Timor will get its first democratically elected president in April and gain full independence in May.But the attention span of the world is short.

However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R.

Many people in rural areas do not have access to banking, making it difficult for them to receive and send money. But a revolutionary mobile telephone system is making it easy to move money, changing Kenyan society. The system was the first of its kind in the world.As Stephen Mbugua works on his farm a half-hour drive from the capital Nairobi, his mobile phone beeps. He is getting a text message saying that his son has sent the elderly farmer some money - through the mobile telephone.Mbugua is a customer of a service called MPESA, offered by a mobile phone company called Safaricom.People who wish to transfer money through their mobile phones can do so at locations across Kenya.And that is good news for Mbugua, who says the service saves him time and money. \"I used to go to Nairobi or to any bank to pay my bills. But right now, since MPESA came, I do not go to Nairobi, I just pay my bill from here,\" he said.Phelister Omari, 22, who works in a hospital in Nairobi, is sending money to her mother. She fills out a form with the amount she wishes to send, plugs that amount into her telephone, and gives the clerk the amount plus extra for charges.People who are sent money go to the agent with their mobile phone, sign a form, and receive the cash.Omari says she appreciates the service. \"It is very fast.

According to Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev, \"I hope we see the resumption of talks. I think it's in everyone's interest.\" Peace talks broke down more than a year ago, and the Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiating table until Israel freezes all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestinians rejected Israel's offer of a partial freeze. Regev says Israel has been ready to resume peace talks all along. \"And unfortunately that's been held up until now because the Palestinian side, unfortunately, has piled on preconditions,\" Regev said.The United States has also pressured Israel for a freeze on construction in the settlements, on grounds that they are an obstacle to peace. But the U.S. has not made a settlement freeze a precondition for peace talks. To bridge the gaps, the U.S. proposed indirect talks, which will probably involve shuttle diplomacy by an American mediator between the Israeli government in Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank town of Ramallah.",

He says villagers are resisting the culling of birds because there have been delays in granting them compensation.\"Authorities in West Bengal admit they are falling behind in attempts to slaughter the affected birds, and have appealed to other states for assistance,\" said Pawar.\"There have been no human infections reported yet in India, but health officials in West Bengal fear that ignorance of the disease is increasing the chances of its spread to humans. There are reports of children playing with chickens in affected villages, and dead birds being dumped in ponds. Human beings can catch bird flu by coming into direct contact with infected poultry.\"\"In Bangladesh, which adjoins West Bengal, the virus has spread to nearly half of the country,\" said Pawar.",

The government's five-party coalition closed ranks against opposition accusations of economic mismanagement and a heated debate over national sovereignty. As Ron Corben reports from Bangkok, a senior minister also discounted any moves of a cabinet reshuffle after the vote. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his cabinet had faced accusations of economic mismanagement and of disregarding Thailand's national sovereignty. After three days of feisty debate on the no-confidence motion, the vote highlighted the unity of the five-party coalition government. The president of the parliament, Chai Chidchob, announced the final tally. He says Mr. Samak received 280 votes, and that there were 162 votes in favor of the no-confidence motion. The opposition has accused Mr. Samak of being unable to manage his government. The commerce minister came under fire over his handling of the country's rice industry.

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him.

But experts say growth has been stymied in the past by persistent economic imbalances, driven partially by high levels of borrowing and debt.Two senior economists briefing reporters Wednesday agreed that past policies aimed at fostering development have had mixed results. Particular criticism has been leveled at what has come to be known as the Washington Consensus.The Washington Consensus is generally defined as a set of late 20th century policy prescriptions advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Those prescriptions emphasized the efficiency of private enterprise and open markets.Many African governments blame those market-oriented policies for the continent's economic stagnation in the 1970s and 80s.Last year's ministerial conference was devoted to examining the state's role in development, and this conference will hear reports based on the results of that meeting.Comments Wednesday by African Union Economic Affairs Commissioner Maxwell Mkwazelamba and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Deputy Chief Abdallah Hamdok revealed that the issue is far from settled.Hamdok argues that recent experience shows economies that have developed fastest have been those where the state has taken the dominant role.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says. It requires us to distribute by air, which will even escalate the cost for the distribution of food to the population in need.” During her recent visit, Cousin witnessed the alarming poor condition of the women and children who had survived the violence.

Democrats need a net total of 23 to assume the House majority, which would likely derail Republican President Donald Trump's policy agenda.The polls closed at 8 p.m. and final results were expected within hours. Voters in the state were also choosing Republican nominees to take on incumbent Governor Tom Wolf and U.S. Senator Bob Casey, both Democrats.Pennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the state Supreme Court found that the current congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans. The redrawn map has made some districts more competitive.In addition, six incumbent House Republicans are not running for re-election, further scrambling the races and requiring voters to become familiar with a raft of first-time candidates.81 candidates for 18 seatsSome 81 candidates are running for 18 congressional seats, including 10 Democrats in a single race.Democrats feel confident they can ultimately win three districts in suburban Philadelphia regardless of which candidates win their primaries on Tuesday because of the liberal tilt of those areas.A more interesting contest comes in the northeastern district being vacated by retiring Representative Charlie Dent, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the House.A historical marker in Allentown, Pennsylvania, May 5, 2018.",

Our correspondent reports the attempt renews tensions between protesters and law enforcement.?This is god**** our park! This is our park! The real people?s park! It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

I write with songwriters; I play with other good musicians,'' Starr told Reuters, noting \"because it's what I do.'' \"It's very hard for me to find a stranger these days because I've been around a long time.'' Starr has witnessed the music industry evolve dramatically over his 50-year career, and consumption is becoming increasingly digital with Apple Inc's iTunes and Amazon.com Inc as well as online streaming platforms such as Spotify and Jay Z's newly-announced Tidal. The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes. Starr himself still prefers purchasing physical copies of music. \"Streaming I don't understand anymore.

Seven were killed and nearly 50 wounded.

Those efforts have proven severely limited, however, prompting advocates to again push for more reforms.\"I think the reason that Native women may go missing at higher rates than other groups of people is very similar to the reason that they are at higher risk for domestic violence and sexual assault,'' said Sarah Deer, a University of Kansas professor, member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and author of a book on sexual violence in Indian Country. \"The legal system is simply not functioning properly [to prevent] these types of things from happening.''At the end of 2017, the FBI's National Crime Information Center database had 633 open missing-person cases for Native American women, who make up 0.4 percent of the U.S. population but 0.7 percent of cases in the figures obtained by The Associated Press.",

The Inter-Parliamentary Union says its Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians is investigating the cases of 311 MPs from 41 countries - a 13 percent increase over 2013.The data reveal 38 percent of the MPs who faced governmental abuse are from Africa, 25 percent from Asia, 18 percent from the Middle East and North Africa, 14 percent from the Americas and five percent from Europe.IPU human rights program manager Rogier Huizenga said the three worst cases in Africa were Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Eritrea.

At a meeting in Berlin, leaders from eight European countries called for regulating financial markets and hedge funds, investment funds that typically lead to aggressive financial strategies.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit, said all financial markets, products and participants that pose a major risk must be regulated.Ms. Merkel also called for world economies to coordinate in establishing sanctions for tax shelters and regions where financial deals are opaque.The European meeting comes ahead of a London summit on the international crisis in early April of the so-called G-20 nations, the world's top economic powers. But it is unclear whether the Europeans' call for widespread regulation will be well received by other G-20 members, which include the United States, China, Japan and several developing nations.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the European leaders had also agreed on the need to shore up international institutions like the World Bank, including in their role in helping the poorest nations.\"We decided that the international institutions should have at least $500 billion to enable them not just to deal with crises, but to enable them to be able to prevent crises,\" said Gordon Brown.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately.

The inaugural ceremonies are steeped in tradition and symbolism meant to show the continuity and strength of the American political system. In this final segment of How America Elects, VOA explains what takes place on Inauguration Day, and why.Several U.S. Presidents have taken the oath of office:\"I, George Walker Bush\" \"I, William Jefferson Clinton\" \"I, George Herbert Walker Bush do solemnly swear\" (Back to Bush) \"that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States(Clinton) \"and will, to the best of my ability,\" (Bush) \"preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States(Bush ) \"so help me, God\" At noon on January 20, more than two months after the election, presidential power transfers from the outgoing occupant of the White House to the one who will be there for the next four years. Inauguration Day is an unbroken chain that stretches back 220 years to 1789, when America's first president, George Washington, took the oath of office.Inauguration Day, says Georgetown University professor Mark Rom, is meant to convey continuity. \"The inauguration is an incredibly powerful symbolic moment for the American people,\" Professor Rom said. \"Because it is the time when one democratically elected president leaves office, and another democratically elected president takes over office. And, the transition is peaceful and ceremonial.",

But rights groups say this ancient system is also fueling the war and leaving the country unprepared to handle the current humanitarian crisis.“When people feel that the state is unable to protect people’s rights and property, of course they will look to their tribes for leadership,” said Hassan Mohsen, 42, a tribesman in the Khawlan village, to the east of the Yemeni capital.Tribal leaders are local rulers that often have more say in the everyday lives of average people than government officials. Tribal leaders are able to maintain this power in part because they are often themselves government representatives and/or religious leaders.“The tribal system has been politicized and the tribes no longer cooperate with each other,” said Abdulbasit Al-Mashwali, a leader of the Yemeni Parliamentarians Union, a government watchdog group in Sana’a. “In the past they filled a humanitarian role, but not anymore. Now it's all political bickering.”The tribal system was officially abandoned with the overthrow of the Imamate in 1962, but the governments that followed kept it in place unofficially, according to Abdulrahman al-Marwani, who heads the Dar Al-Salam, a human rights advocacy group in Sana'a.“For half a century governments have been handing over the nation’s wealth to the tribal leaders,” he said. “And the tribal leaders also get money from foreign sources to pressure the state’s political decisions.”Yemeni tribesmen await remains of one of their own killed in clashes, Khawlan al-Tyal, a tribal area east of Sana'a, September 2015.

She said the use of both air-dropped and ground-launched cluster munitions had increased since Russia joined Syrian military operations in 2015, but that their use had fallen off this year.\"There are several reasons for that,\" she said. \"One is that … the territory held by the opposition forces has been shrinking in the past year.

From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago.The scenario underscores how difficult it is for Trump, who has tried to distance herself from the brand that bears her name, to separate business from politics in her new position at the White House.As the first daughter crafts a political career from her West Wing office, her brand is flourishing, despite boycotts and several stores limiting her merchandise. U.S. imports, almost all of them from China, shot up an estimated 166 percent last year, while sales hit record levels in 2017. The brand, which Trump still owns, says distribution is growing. It has launched new activewear and affordable jewelry lines and is working to expand its global intellectual property footprint. In addition to winning the approvals from China, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC applied for at least nine new trademarks in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Canada and the U.S. after the election.'Put business on hold,' some sayThe commercial currents of the Trump White House are unprecedented in modern American politics, ethics lawyers say.",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

For unemployed workers from South Asia, that is sometimes not an option. In Dubai's hey day, the sound of construction was everywhere. High rises and tourist resorts were built by legions of foreign workers, most of them from India and Pakistan. Dubai became an international magnet, reinventing itself as a financial capital and tourist mecca in the Persian Gulf. Then the global crisis reached this outpost and boom turned into bust.Now, these men - like thousands of others - are out of work.

He came to the United Arab Emirates two years ago, but says he recently lost his job. And, now, without money coming in, life is hard.\"No money for the foods [sic], everything is so expensive, medicine and rents,\" said Abbasi.These men were among the army of foreign laborers that built Dubai when the economy was booming. Many have been unemployed for more than a month. They say they cannot return home because their employers are holding their passports and have ordered them to wait until work picks up.More than half of the construction projects in the United Arab Emirates, worth $582 billion, have been put on hold, according to the market research firm, Proleads.

The Swiss humanitarian agency says an explosion of conflict and violence, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, is threatening regional stability and putting development prospects of impoverished countries at risk.The International Committee of the Red Cross says the nature of armed conflict is changing. ICRC President Peter Maurer said new kinds of crises are emerging, in new combinations, often with a regional dimension. “We are not anymore in a situation where we have a clear cut international or internal armed conflicts with clear cut front lines and positions unfolding in front of us. We see international armed conflict, internal armed conflict, criminal violence, inter-communal violence, super-positioning itself in the same context,” he said.Maurer said the conflict in Syria has long ceased to be a civil war. It has become a regional crisis engulfing Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said extremism is deepening some of the conflicts being waged, leading to increasingly violent behavior.“Two-hundred thousand people have been killed since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, 9200 civilians have been killed since the beginning of this year in Iraq.

Culture and Tourism Minister Ambika Soni congratulated the people of India and said the government is happy that Mahatma Gandhi's heritage \"to which we are emotionally bonded\" has been saved.An Indian businessman, Vijay Mallya, successfully bid for the items of the Indian independence leader for $1.8 million in New York after frantic efforts by the Indian government to stop the controversial auction failed. His representative says the items have been bought for India. The items include Gandhi's trademark wire-rimmed spectacles, a brass bowl and plate, worn leather sandals and a pocket watch. Gandhi is a national icon who inspired millions of Indians to join a non-violent struggle against British rule.

Here's a look at some of the claims we've examined:MS-13 Trump: \"We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.\"The facts: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in a speech this week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ``and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members.'' On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ``our partners in Central America.'' That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. Opioids Trump: Changes in immigration policies, including more border security, ``will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.''The facts: Drugs being brought across borders are only part of the problem contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention, about 40 percent of the opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some are abused by the people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market.

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country.

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be?

In December, international negotiators will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a new U.N. treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the climate change agreement that expires in 2012. In advance of that meeting, the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has released a new science report that underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for governments to act. The UNEP report presents scientific evidence that has emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its last report in 2007. The \"Climate Change Science Compendium\" affirms that climate change is accelerating faster than previous estimates. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner says evidence of human-generated warming is \"unequivocal\" and \"just in time for us to appreciate how the magnitude of change, the scale of change and the pace of change are in fact occurring.\"Findings from some 400 peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals and research institutes are woven into the report's chapters on earth systems, ecosystems, ice, oceans and climate management. The data show that global carbon emissions - which rose 1.1 percent from 1990 to 1999 - climbed 3.5 percent from 2000-2007. Rapid glacier-melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification will become complex problems, Steiner says, in a world whose population is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. \"And herein lies another vital message in the report,\" he says.",

While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey. In comparison, less than half of those polled in 2001 backed reduced prison time. \"The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs,\" Pew researchers wrote. The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 through Feb. 23, comes as policy makers and top U.S. law enforcement officials reexamine the nation's drug policy to allow judges greater discretion in sentencing offenders, although some prosecutors have balked at the effort. The Obama administration has endorsed reducing prison sentences in federal drug cases, an idea some Republicans also endorse. Lawmakers in Congress in both political parties are also revisiting the issue.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

The system's ability to intercept enemy missiles fills a gap in the current missile defense system deployed on the Korean Peninsula.The deployment, however, has encountered strong opposition from China, which is concerned that THAAD will undermine the strategic deterrence of China's long- and mid-range missiles, as well as the regional military balance.FILE - People watch a TV screen showing a file footage of a missile launch conducted by North Korea, at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, March 18, 2016.Rose also said the United States understands China's concerns, and has always hoped to explain that the deployment will not affect China's strategic deterrent.\"THAAD's single-stage interceptors deployed in [South Korea] would not have the range or capability to intercept Chinese ICBMs headed to the United States,\" he said. \"It is pure physics.\"",

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Weimin said the islands, known as Huangyan in China, are an integral part of Chinese territory and that any Philippine claim to them is \"completely baseless.\"\"",

Western nations and regional neighbors accuse the North of using the launch as a ploy to test a ballistic missile that could later be fitted with a nuclear warhead.The U.N. chief repeated warnings that the launch, which is set to take place sometime between Thursday and Monday, will raise tensions in the region. He also said it \"clearly\" violates a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at reining in North Korea's nuclear weapons program.Meanwhile, military forces in South Korea and Japan were on high alert Thursday on what the North says is the first day of a five-day window for the launch.Any plans for a Thursday launch dimmed by mid-day with no sign of new activity at the launch pad outside a cloud-covered Pyongyang. In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated his nation's appeal for Pyongyang to cancel the launch but said Japanese forces are ready to shoot the rocket down if it strays over Japanese territory.\"In case it happens, we are on full alert.",

At the Women’s Mosque of America in Los Angeles, male worshippers older than 12 are excluded, making the new Berkeley mosque the first of its kind in the country.“We uplift the female, and just as the Prophet loved women, we must follow in his footsteps and love ourselves and each other,” she said.Keeble is a 40-something convert from Christianity with a master’s degree in religious leadership from the Starr King School of Ministry, a seminary affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, which has donated space for the mosque.At Qal’bu Maryam, there is no imam, as the cleric who conducts worship at a mosque is called. Rather, female lay leaders will rotate in leading the prayers and the talks.About 50 or so women and men, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, attended the jummah or traditional Friday service, listening to prayer leader Crystal Keshawarz chant the holy Arabic words, “God is great” or “Allahu Akbar.”",

How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers. “It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle,” said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.A pro-Russian man (not seen) holds a Russian flag behind an armed servicemen on top of a Russian army vehicle outside a Ukrainian border guard post in the Crimean town of Balaclava, March 1, 2014.Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich. But for the authorities in Kiev and local politicians still loyal to Ukraine, the rapid pace of events were evidence of a carefully orchestrated campaign from Moscow. Moscow denies any role in installing Aksyonov, who is known from his business days by the nickname “The Goblin”. But even those close to the Kremlin say Russia picked him. “Moscow always bet on Yanukovich. But after the coup in Kiev on Feb. 22 ... Moscow decided it needed to back the secession of Crimea from Ukraine.",

They had been expecting a more moderate increase.The Reserve Bank will now lend to banks at eight percent. Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao says with inflation running at more than nine percent, he has no other options. ?Inflation is expected to remain elevated for a few more months before moderating towards the later part of this year,\" says Subbarao. \"The challenge for the government and for the Reserve Bank is to ensure that demand is constrained in the short term to bring inflation down.?The surge in inflation was triggered by high food prices, which have jumped more than 10 percent in the last year and are hurting millions of poor people in the country. Hikes in fuel prices have led to a further spike in inflation. This is the 11th time that the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates since March of last year. The successive hikes have already begun dampening an economy which had been growing briskly at eight-and-a-half percent. However, the bank says there is no evidence of a sharp slowdown and expects growth to stay at eight percent.That optimism is not shared by most economists, who say that Asia?",

His father was a policeman and his mother was a homemaker. During his first 12 years, he moved five times throughout Bavaria as his father accepted various law enforcement positions.In 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Germany's Chancellor. In 1939, Ratzinger entered a seminary in Traunstein. And later that year, the World War II broke out.John Allen -- one of Ratzinger's biographers -- says soon after, he was forced to become a member of the Hitler Youth. \"In 1943, membership in the Hitler Youth became mandatory for anyone who was enrolled in a German school. So he was put on the books as a Hitler Youth member, but he never took part in it,\" says Allen. \"And in fact, he found a sympathetic teacher who allowed him to continue coming to classes, even though he didn't have his Hitler Youth card, which, in theory, all German youth were supposed to have.\"Allen says Ratzinger and his fellow seminarians were also pressed into part-time auxiliary military roles -- assigned to an anti-aircraft defense corps at a BMW munitions factory outside of Munich.

Mr. Obama has been waiting for the election dispute to be resolved before announcing his new war strategy. As the fighting continues to rage, U.S. officials stated repeatedly the election process had to be settled before President Barack Obama could make a reasoned decision about sending additional troops and resources to Afghanistan. Administration officials say the United States needs to make sure it has a credible partner in the Afghan government before any change in strategy. Analysts say the runoff election will add credibility to the new government and Mr. Obama applauded the move. \"President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think, have shown that they have the interests of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law and an insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done,\" said the president. Election officials are scrambling to organize the new ballot as the fierce Afghan winter approaches and the country faces a growing threat from the Taliban. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel has advised President Obama on Afghan policy. \"We have got to make sure that this second round is not marred by fraud and corruption like the first round,\" he said.
