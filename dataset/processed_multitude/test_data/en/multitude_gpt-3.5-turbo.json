The dam, which is being built on the Blue Nile, is set to become Africa's largest hydroelectric dam and is expected to generate around 6,000 MW of electricity.While Ethiopia sees the project as a source of national pride and an important step towards development, Egypt is concerned that the dam will significantly reduce its share of the Nile's water. The Nile is a lifeline for Egypt, providing almost all of its water supply. Egypt has long relied on the Nile for agriculture and as a source of drinking water for its growing population.Now, as the dam's construction is nearing completion, Egypt's rice farmers are seeing rough times downstream. With reduced water supply, the farmers are struggling to irrigate their crops and maintain their livelihoods. Rice is a staple crop in Egypt and the country is the world's largest importer of the grain.Egypt and Ethiopia have been engaged in talks for years to find a solution that satisfies both countries. However, these talks have been largely unsuccessful, with both sides accusing the other of being inflexible.Recently, tensions have escalated, with Egypt warning Ethiopia of \"consequences\" if the dam is filled without reaching a satisfactory agreement. Egypt has called on the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the dispute.The situation is complex and the consequences of the GERD's completion are still uncertain. However, one thing is clear: the downstream effects of the dam's construction on Egypt's farmers are a stark reminder of the challenges that come with large-scale infrastructure projects in shared waterways.",

The shuttle was originally scheduled to take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday but has been postponed until at least Wednesday.NASA officials announced on Sunday that the delay was necessary due to a low-pressure system that has brought rain and strong winds to the area. The weather conditions have prevented engineers from completing their final checks and preparations.This is not the first time that weather has caused a delay for the space shuttle program. In fact, NASA has had to postpone several launches over the past few years due to weather-related issues.Despite the setbacks, NASA officials remain optimistic that the mission will be a success once the weather improves. The shuttle will be carrying important scientific equipment and supplies to the International Space Station as well as a team of astronauts.The shuttle's crew has been preparing for this mission for months and is eager to finally embark on their journey.",

Yemen's tribes have a long-standing tradition of rivalry and conflict, which has made it difficult to reach a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict.The conflict in Yemen began in 2014 when Houthi rebels overthrew the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The situation has since escalated, with a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launching a military intervention in 2015 to try to restore the government. The conflict has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of Yemenis facing famine and displacement.The tribal system in Yemen is deeply ingrained in the country's culture and society. Many Yemenis identify strongly with their tribe and view their tribal affiliation as a central part of their identity. This tribal identity can be a source of pride and solidarity, but it can also lead to conflict when tribes feel that their honor or interests have been threatened.The Yemeni government has traditionally relied on tribal leaders to maintain stability in the country, but the ongoing conflict has created divisions within the tribal system. Some tribes have aligned themselves with the government, while others have joined the Houthi rebellion. This has further complicated efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.The United Nations has been working to broker a peace deal between the warring parties in Yemen, but progress has been slow. The involvement of tribal leaders in the peace process could be key to reaching a lasting solution, but it will require delicate negotiations and a deep understanding of the country's tribal system.The conflict in Yemen has already caused immense suffering for millions of Yemenis, and it is clear that the involvement of tribal rivalries has only deepened the crisis. If peace is to be achieved in Yemen, it will require a concerted effort to address the underlying issues that have contributed to the conflict, including the tribal system.",

The package, which amounts to $33 billion SGD ($23.2 billion USD), is aimed at helping businesses and workers affected by the outbreak.The announcement came after Singapore reported a 2.2% contraction in its gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2020, marking its worst performance since the global financial crisis in 2009. The city-state, which heavily relies on trade and tourism, has been hit hard by the outbreak, which has led to a sharp decline in global demand and disrupted supply chains.The stimulus package, dubbed the \"Fortitude Budget,\" includes measures such as wage subsidies, rental relief for businesses, and support for sectors such as aviation and tourism. It also includes funds for healthcare and social support.According to Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, the package is necessary to cushion the impact of the pandemic and ensure a strong recovery for the country. \"We are sparing no effort to save jobs, preserve capabilities, and support enterprises,\" he said in a statement.The package brings the total amount of government support for Singapore's economy to more than $92 billion SGD ($64.8 billion USD), or close to 20% of the country's GDP. The government has also said that it is prepared to do more if needed.The announcement of the stimulus package was welcomed by business leaders and economists, who see it as a crucial step towards stabilizing the economy. However, they also cautioned that the road to recovery will be long and uncertain, as the pandemic continues to ravage economies around the world.",

This comes as the Trump administration continues its efforts to fulfill its campaign promise of boosting economic growth and creating more jobs.The tax reform package is expected to be unveiled in September and would include significant changes to the country's tax code, including a cut in corporate tax rates and the simplification of individual tax brackets. The aim of these changes is to make the tax system simpler, fairer, and more competitive, thereby attracting businesses and boosting economic growth.President Trump has been pushing for a major overhaul of the tax code since his election, arguing that the current system is overly complex, burdensome, and unfair. He has also said that tax reform would be a crucial component of his economic policy, and that it would be vital to achieving his goal of creating 25 million new jobs over the next decade.Speaker Ryan echoed these sentiments, stating that tax reform was necessary to help middle-class families and small businesses. He added that the House was committed to working with the Trump administration to ensure that the reforms are passed by the end of the year.Despite the widespread agreement on the need for tax reform, the details of the package have yet to be finalized, and there are likely to be disagreements among lawmakers on specific measures.

The nation was still in the midst of healing and recovery, and the results of the elections would have a major impact on the direction of the country.The elections were seen as a test of the popularity and effectiveness of President George W. Bush and his policies. The Republican Party, which held a slim majority in both houses of Congress, was hoping to maintain and potentially expand its power. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, was hoping to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq and other issues to gain seats and potentially take control of one or both houses of Congress.In the end, the Republicans were able to maintain their majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, their margin of control was reduced, with Democrats making gains in both chambers. The results were seen as a rebuke to President Bush and his policies, and a sign that the nation was growing more divided and skeptical of the Republican Party's agenda.The 2002 midterm elections set the stage for the contentious political climate of the following years. The country remained deeply divided over issues such as the war in Iraq, healthcare, and the economy. The results of the elections would continue to reverberate through the rest of President Bush's term, and would have lasting impacts on American politics.",

According to reports, the number of people trying to make the dangerous journey has increased significantly, with over 1,000 migrants arriving in the UK by boat in just the past few weeks.The majority of these migrants are said to be from countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, with many seeking refuge from war, poverty, and persecution in their home countries. While the UK government has pledged to crack down on illegal immigration, many believe that more needs to be done to provide support and assistance to those who are seeking a better life in the UK.The increase in migrant arrivals has sparked concern among local authorities, who are struggling to cope with the influx of new arrivals. Some have called for more resources to be allocated to help support these migrants and ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect.Despite the risks involved, it seems that many migrants are still willing to take the chance and make the perilous journey across the English Channel. As long as the conditions in their home countries remain dire and the UK continues to offer the promise of a better life, it seems likely that we will continue to see more and more migrants attempting to reach Britain via this route.",

This initiative will provide much-needed financial support to countries already struggling with high levels of debt and limited resources.The debt relief plan is part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) launched in April 2020. Under this initiative, eligible countries can apply for a temporary suspension of debt service payments to official bilateral creditors. This allows them to redirect financial resources towards essential healthcare and social spending during the pandemic.The $40 billion debt relief package will help countries eligible for the DSSI to further reduce their debt burden and provide additional resources to address the economic fallout of the pandemic. The World Bank and IMF have stated that the debt relief is necessary to prevent a debt crisis in the poorest countries, which could lead to long-term economic and social damage.The debt relief will be financed by a combination of resources from the World Bank, IMF, and donor countries. Donor countries are expected to contribute approximately $11.5 billion to the initiative, which will be used to cover the costs of debt relief for the poorest countries.The World Bank and IMF have called on all official creditors to participate in the DSSI and provide debt relief to eligible countries. They have also urged private creditors to participate on comparable terms.The debt relief plan is a significant step towards supporting the most vulnerable countries during the pandemic and ensuring they have the resources necessary to address the health and economic challenges they face.

He served as EU trade commissioner from 1999 to 2004, and prior to that held various high-level positions in the French government and the European Commission.In his acceptance speech, Lamy emphasized the need for the WTO to adapt to changing global realities and to work towards a more inclusive and sustainable global trading system. He also called for greater cooperation among member states and for the WTO to be more responsive to the needs of developing countries.Lamy's appointment was welcomed by many WTO members and international trade experts, who see him as a pragmatic leader with a deep understanding of the complexities of global trade and a commitment to multilateralism.However, Lamy faces an uphill task in restoring the credibility and effectiveness of the WTO, which has been weakened by years of disputes and inaction. Many member states are also pushing for reforms to address issues such as intellectual property rights, digital trade, and environmental standards.Lamy's success will depend on his ability to bring member states together and to build consensus around a shared vision for the future of global trade. As he takes on this challenging role, the world will be watching closely to see if he can lead the WTO towards a more prosperous and sustainable future.",

In an interview with a Mexican newspaper, Diaz-Canel stated that he believes in the right of all individuals to marry the person they love, regardless of gender.This marks a significant shift in Cuban politics, as the country has traditionally been more conservative on LGBTQ+ rights. In 2019, the Cuban government proposed a new constitution that included a provision that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman. However, this provision was ultimately removed after widespread public debate and criticism.Diaz-Canel's support for same-sex marriage comes at a time when LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly being recognized in Cuba. In recent years, there has been progress in the areas of employment discrimination, HIV/AIDS education, and transgender rights.However, there is still a long way to go in terms of full equality and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ community in Cuba. Same-sex marriage is not yet legal, and LGBTQ+ individuals still face stigma and discrimination.Diaz-Canel's public support for same-sex marriage is a step forward in the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights in Cuba.

The elimination of measles is defined as the interruption of endemic transmission of the virus in a specific geographic area, which requires at least three years of zero reported cases following a mass vaccination campaign. Bhutan and Maldives have been able to achieve this milestone through their strong commitment to immunization programs and sustained efforts to reach remote and marginalized populations.\"Eliminating measles is a testament to the remarkable efforts and dedication of health workers and communities in these countries to protect themselves and their children from a disease that is entirely preventable with a safe and effective vaccine,\" said Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director of WHO South-East Asia.The achievement of Bhutan and Maldives is a significant step towards the goal of the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012-2020, which aims to eliminate measles in five WHO regions by 2020. Currently, four of the six WHO regions have validated the elimination of measles, including the Americas, Europe, the Western Pacific, and now, South-East Asia.However, measles remains a significant public health concern globally, with an estimated 140,000 deaths reported in 2018, mostly in children under the age of five. The WHO has called for increased efforts and investments in measles vaccination campaigns and surveillance systems to ensure that all children are protected from this deadly disease.",

The ASEAN leaders met on Saturday to discuss the political situation in Burma, where a military coup took place in February, leading to widespread protests and violence.During the meeting, the leaders emphasized the need for dialogue and reconciliation in the country. They also called for the release of political prisoners and the restoration of democracy.ASEAN has previously been criticized for not taking stronger action against Burma's military regime. However, the organization's Secretary-General, Dato Lim Jock Hoi, defended ASEAN's approach, saying that the group's engagement with Burma has been helpful in promoting stability and development in the region.Despite this, some countries, such as the United States, have imposed sanctions on Burma in response to the military coup. The ASEAN leaders' call for dropping these sanctions could be seen as a move towards normalizing relations with Burma and promoting greater cooperation within the region.As the political situation in Burma remains uncertain, the ASEAN leaders' statement is seen as a significant development in the ongoing efforts to address the crisis. It remains to be seen how the international community will respond to the call for dropping sanctions, but the ASEAN leaders are hopeful that their efforts will help bring about positive change in Burma.",

The raid involved a large number of troops and was the first of its kind since the US-led invasion began just a few weeks ago. The move is seen as a departure from the initial strategy of relying heavily on air strikes and special forces operations, and marks a new phase in the conflict. According to military sources, the aim of the raid was to gather intelligence on Taliban forces and disrupt their operations in the region. Despite the early morning timing, there were reports of heavy resistance from Taliban fighters, who used small arms and grenades to defend their positions. US forces responded with force, and after several hours of fighting, the Taliban stronghold was secured. The success of the raid is expected to lead to more ground operations in the coming weeks, as the US seeks to gain a foothold in the region and assert its dominance over the Taliban. While the move is seen as risky by some, others believe it is necessary in order to achieve a lasting peace in the country. The raid comes just a day after the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, issued a statement urging his fighters to step up their attacks against the US and its allies. The statement has been seen as a sign of growing desperation within the Taliban ranks, as they struggle to hold onto their power in the face of overwhelming US military might. The situation in Afghanistan remains highly volatile, with reports of fighting and unrest coming in from all corners of the country.

In Hungary, for example, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's government has curbed media freedom and restricted the powers of the judiciary, leading to concerns about the erosion of democratic norms.Similarly, Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party has been accused of undermining the independence of the judiciary and media, with critics warning that the country is moving away from the democratic values it embraced after the fall of communism.Turkey, once seen as a model Muslim democracy, has been on a similar path since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government declared a state of emergency following a failed coup attempt in 2016. The government has been accused of cracking down on opposition groups, silencing critical media outlets, and curtailing civil liberties.The rise of illiberal democracies in Europe has sparked debate about the future of democracy in the region.

Many blamed Moscow for the aggression and accused them of violating international law, while others saw it as an opportunity to reunify a historically Russian territory.However, what is often overlooked in this conversation is the role that separatist movements played in delivering Crimea to Moscow.Crimea has a complex history, and tensions between ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have existed for decades. In 1991, when Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union, Crimea remained part of the country, but there was a strong movement to make it a separate republic or join Russia.In 2014, the pro-Russian President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted in a coup, which led to an uprising in Crimea. Separatists and Russian-backed militias quickly took control of the region, holding a controversial referendum that resulted in a vote for annexation by Russia.While the referendum was widely criticized for being illegitimate, there were many Crimean residents who genuinely believed that their interests were better served under Russian rule. The separatists capitalized on this sentiment and used it to their advantage, effectively delivering Crimea to Moscow.The annexation of Crimea remains a contentious issue, and it is unlikely that the debate will end anytime soon. However, it is important to remember the role that the separatists played in the events that led up to it. By understanding this, we can gain a more nuanced perspective on the situation and perhaps find a path towards a peaceful resolution.",

The children, who were aged between 13 and 17, were previously associated with armed groups in the country. The release is part of a wider effort to demobilize and reintegrate child soldiers into their communities. In a statement, UNICEF South Sudan Representative Andrea Suley said the release \"represents a significant milestone in our efforts to end the recruitment and use of children by armed groups.\" She added that the children would receive medical care, psychosocial support and education, and would be helped to reunite with their families. South Sudan has been gripped by civil war since 2013, with various armed groups fighting for control. Child soldiers have been used by both government and opposition forces. The UN says that around 19,000 children have been recruited into armed groups since the start of the conflict. The release of the child soldiers was organized by the South Sudan People's Defence Force and the National Committee for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration. UNICEF provided transportation, medical support and other assistance. The organization said it would continue to work with all sides in the conflict to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers. \"This release gives hope to other children in South Sudan who continue to be used by armed groups that they too can be set free and return to their families,\" said Suley.",

This declaration comes in the wake of concerns that the island nation might be considering a \"Cyprusxit\" following its recent banking crisis.Cyprus, which has been a member of the eurozone since 2008, faced a banking crisis in 2013 that nearly led to its exit from the single currency. The country's banks were heavily exposed to Greek debt, and when the Greek economy crashed, Cyprus' banks were left with billions of euros in bad loans.The Cypriot government responded with a €10 billion bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. This bailout came with a series of tough conditions, including the restructuring of the country's banking sector and the imposition of strict capital controls.Despite these challenges, the Cypriot government has remained committed to the eurozone. In a recent statement, Cyprus' President Nicos Anastasiades said that the country was \"fully committed\" to the eurozone and that its membership was \"non-negotiable.\"Anastasiades also pointed to the benefits of eurozone membership, including access to a stable currency, low inflation, and the ability to borrow at low rates. He argued that leaving the eurozone would cause \"economic and social chaos\" for Cyprus and its citizens.The Cypriot government's commitment to the eurozone has been welcomed by other EU member states, who have praised the country's efforts to reform its banking sector and improve its economy.",

The 81-year-old justice has served on the highest court in the United States for more than 30 years and has been a pivotal swing vote on a number of controversial cases. Kennedy was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. He is widely seen as a moderate conservative and has been known to vote with both the liberal and conservative wings of the court on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and affirmative action. Kennedy’s retirement now gives President Trump the opportunity to appoint his second Supreme Court justice, following the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. The appointment could have significant implications for a number of contentious issues, such as abortion rights, immigration, and gun control. Justice Kennedy’s retirement has sent shockwaves through the political world and is likely to be a major issue in the upcoming mid-term elections. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised to move quickly to confirm a new justice before the November elections, while Democrats have already begun to mobilize against the appointment, arguing that it should be left to the next president to decide. The retirement of Justice Kennedy comes at a time when the Supreme Court is already deeply divided along ideological lines, with four conservative justices and four liberal justices. Kennedy’s successor is likely to be a key deciding vote on many of the court’s future cases and could significantly shape the direction of the court for years to come.",

There have been concerns raised about the amount of resources being allocated towards monitoring potential terrorist threats versus other criminal activity.Critics have suggested that the security services may be overly focused on preventing terrorism at the expense of other types of crime, such as cybercrime and organized crime. They argue that this approach could be leaving the country vulnerable to other threats.In response, the security services have defended their priorities and pointed to their successes in preventing terrorist attacks. They have also emphasized the importance of balancing the need for surveillance with the need to protect individual privacy and civil liberties.The debate over surveillance priorities is likely to continue as the security services work to keep the country safe in an increasingly complex and challenging threat environment.",

The polls will be closely watched by regional observers, who are hoping for a return to democratic governance in the country.According to experts, the outcome of the election will be crucial for ASEAN, which has been struggling with a wave of authoritarianism in recent years. Thailand is seen as a bellwether for the region, and a successful transition to democracy could inspire other countries to follow suit.However, there are concerns that the election may not be free and fair, given the military's continued grip on power in the country. Opposition parties have complained of harassment and intimidation, and there are fears that the military may try to manipulate the results.Despite these concerns, many in the region remain hopeful that Thailand will be able to make a successful transition to democracy. The country has a long history of political turmoil, but analysts say that the current juncture may offer a unique opportunity for change.Ultimately, the fate of democracy in ASEAN will depend on the outcome of the election in Thailand. If the country is able to hold a free and fair vote and transition peacefully to a democratic government, it could serve as a model for the rest of the region. If not, the wave of authoritarianism that has swept through ASEAN in recent years may continue to gain momentum.",

The woman, who has not been named, was awarded AU$1.5m ($1.1m) in compensation after taking legal action against her traffickers. The case is being hailed as a landmark victory for victims of human trafficking in Australia, and marks the first time that a victim has received such a large sum in compensation. The woman was trafficked to Australia in 2012 and was forced to work in the sex industry in Sydney and Melbourne. The case was brought against the woman's traffickers, who were found to have breached Australian workplace laws, including the Fair Work Act and the Migration Act. The woman was also found to have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse during her time in the sex industry. Speaking after the settlement was reached, the woman's lawyer, Jennifer Kanis, said: \"This is an incredible result for our client. It sends a message to traffickers and those who exploit vulnerable workers that they will be held accountable for their actions.\" The case has drawn attention to the issue of human trafficking in Australia, with campaigners calling for more to be done to protect victims. According to the Australian Federal Police, there were 223 reported cases of human trafficking in the country between 2015 and 2019. The settlement is also expected to have wider implications for businesses in Australia, with experts suggesting that it could encourage more victims to come forward and pursue legal action against their traffickers. Australia has taken steps in recent years to combat human trafficking, including the establishment of the Australian Federal Police's Human Trafficking Taskforce. However, campaigners argue that more needs to be done to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers, particularly in the sex industry.",

She added that \"some forces in the United States are using the Taiwan issue to engage in political manipulation and challenge China's bottom line\". Chunying also urged the US to adhere to the One China policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China, including Taiwan.The United States and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic relations, but they maintain close economic and military ties. President Tsai's visit to the US came after the US State Department approved a potential arms sale worth $1.8 billion to Taiwan. The deal includes 135 air-to-ground missiles and other equipment, which China has denounced as a violation of its sovereignty.The escalating tensions between China and the US over Taiwan come as the two nations continue to spar over trade and technology issues. The US has accused China of stealing intellectual property and technology, and has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods in response. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own.The situation is further complicated by the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, which have sparked criticism from both the US and China.

However, many conservationists and environmental groups have criticized the decision, arguing that the bluefin population is still not at a sustainable level and that removing protections could have dire consequences for the species in the long term.The bluefin tuna is one of the most valuable fish in the world, with individual fish selling for tens of thousands of dollars on the international market. In recent years, the popularity of sushi and sashimi has led to a surge in demand for bluefin, causing widespread overfishing and depletion of the population. Conservation efforts have been underway for several years, with many countries imposing strict catch limits and regulations in an attempt to preserve the species.The US decision to delist the bluefin could have significant repercussions for global conservation efforts, as it may encourage other countries to follow suit and loosen regulations on fishing.

The preliminary report by the French air accident investigation agency (BEA) suggested that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, had deliberately crashed the plane, apparently due to mental health issues. The report has sparked a debate about whether better monitoring of pilots is necessary to prevent such incidents.The BEA report has proposed measures that would require airlines to screen their pilots for psychological issues, as well as implementing more rigorous monitoring of pilots who have been identified as having mental health problems. The French agency also recommended that pilots undergo more regular medical checks to ensure they are fit to fly.Many in the aviation industry are already taking action to address these recommendations. For example, German airline Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, has already introduced a new rule requiring two people to be in the cockpit at all times. This is aimed at preventing a repeat of the Germanwings crash, where Lubitz was left alone in the cockpit and was able to lock the captain out of the cabin.The issue of mental health checks for pilots is not a new one, but the Germanwings crash has brought it to the forefront of public consciousness. Airlines and aviation authorities around the world will be closely watching the outcome of the investigation into the crash, and will no doubt be implementing changes to ensure that passengers can continue to fly safely in the future.",

This comes after years of violent conflict between the militant group and the Pakistani military, which has resulted in significant casualties on both sides.The Taliban's decision to withdraw is being seen as a significant development in the ongoing peace negotiations between the group and the Pakistani government. The move was announced by Taliban spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan, who said that the group would now focus on political activities and dialogue with the government.The Pakistani government has welcomed the Taliban's decision to withdraw, with Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan saying that it was a positive step towards peace and stability in the region. However, he also cautioned that the government would continue to take action against any group that posed a threat to national security.Bajaur is a strategically important district that has been a stronghold of the Taliban for many years. The group has used the area as a base for launching attacks on Pakistani security forces and conducting cross-border raids into Afghanistan.While the withdrawal of the Taliban from Bajaur is a positive development, there are concerns that the group may simply relocate to other parts of the country, or even to neighboring Afghanistan. Many analysts believe that a lasting peace in Pakistan will require a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of militancy, including poverty, political instability, and the ongoing conflict in neighboring Afghanistan.Nevertheless, the Taliban's withdrawal from Bajaur is a significant development that could pave the way for further progress in peace negotiations between the group and the Pakistani government.",

This move comes as a surprise as Qatar had deployed around 450 soldiers in the area since 2017 as a part of an international effort to resolve a border dispute between the neighboring countries.According to sources, the withdrawal was completed on June 12th, and the decision was conveyed to the countries involved in the effort. The reason for the withdrawal is yet to be officially announced by Qatar, but it is believed to be a part of the country's efforts to improve its relations with its neighboring states.The border dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea has a long history and has led to several armed clashes in the past. The presence of Qatari troops was seen as a sign of progress towards resolving the dispute, but it remains to be seen how this latest development will impact the situation on the ground.The withdrawal of Qatari troops from the border is also likely to impact the ongoing efforts to end the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region. Qatar has been facing a boycott from several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, since 2017 over allegations of supporting terrorism. The withdrawal of Qatari troops from the Djibouti-Eritrea border could be seen as a move towards easing tensions with these countries.In conclusion, the withdrawal of Qatari troops from the Djibouti-Eritrea border is a significant development and could have implications for regional stability. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but it is clear that Qatar is taking steps towards improving its relations with its neighbors.",

The report noted that \"minorities are often perceived as a problem to be solved rather than a valuable asset to be embraced.\"The issue is not limited to just ethnic minorities. LGBT+ rights groups have also reported feeling sidelined, with little progress being made on their key issues. Similarly, disability rights campaigners have raised concerns about the accessibility of the Parliament buildings and meetings.The lack of representation of minorities is not only a moral issue, but also a practical one.

During his campaign, President Trump criticized Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba and threatened to reverse them. However, he has yet to take any major action towards Cuba.Tillerson's remarks suggest that the administration is now considering a more aggressive approach towards Cuba.

Additionally, many U.S. businesses have been eager to enter the Cuban market, and a reversal of policies could hurt their bottom lines.Tillerson did not provide any details on what steps the administration plans to take towards Cuba.

The outbreaks have been reported in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.In India, the state of Kerala is grappling with its worst outbreak of bird flu in recent years. More than 35,000 birds have been culled in the state so far, and several districts have been declared bird flu-hit zones.In Nepal, authorities have confirmed bird flu outbreaks in several districts, and have culled more than 65,000 birds in the affected areas. Similarly, in Bangladesh, more than 10,000 birds have been culled in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have also reported bird flu outbreaks in recent weeks, with authorities taking swift measures to cull infected birds and disinfect farms.The H5N1 strain of bird flu is highly contagious among poultry and can be transmitted to humans, causing severe respiratory illness and, in some cases, death. Health experts have urged people to take precautions, such as avoiding contact with sick or dead birds and washing hands frequently.Authorities in the affected countries have assured the public that they are taking all necessary steps to contain the outbreaks, and have urged people to report any suspected cases of bird flu to the authorities.",

Tsvangirai, who heads the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has been a vocal critic of Mugabe's government and has accused him of mismanaging the economy and violating human rights. However, in a surprise move, Tsvangirai said he is willing to engage with Mugabe to find a solution to the country's problems. \"I believe that we must put the interests of the people of Zimbabwe first and foremost,\" Tsvangirai said in a statement. \"That is why I am willing to meet with President Mugabe to discuss how we can work together to resolve the crisis.\"The announcement comes amid growing frustration among Zimbabweans over the state of the economy, which has been hit hard by a shortage of foreign currency and a lack of investment. In recent weeks, there have been protests and strikes across the country, with many Zimbabweans calling for Mugabe to step down.The government has responded by cracking down on opposition groups and arresting activists, leading to allegations of human rights abuses. Tsvangirai has condemned the crackdown and called for a return to democratic principles.It is not yet clear when the meeting between Tsvangirai and Mugabe will take place, but analysts say it could be a significant step towards resolving the crisis in Zimbabwe. Both leaders have a history of animosity, but Tsvangirai's willingness to engage with Mugabe may indicate a willingness to compromise.\"I hope that this meeting will be a positive step towards finding a solution to the crisis,\" Tsvangirai said. \"We cannot continue like this.",

The terminals are located in the so-called \"oil crescent\" region of eastern Libya, which is responsible for much of the country's oil production.Haftar's forces launched a surprise attack on the terminals on Sunday, quickly overpowering the militia and taking control of the area. The move is seen as a significant victory for Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army, which has been vying for power with the internationally recognized government in the capital, Tripoli.The oil terminals have been a major point of contention in Libya's ongoing civil war, with various militia groups vying for control of the valuable infrastructure. The terminals had been under the control of a militia group known as the Petroleum Facilities Guard, which had struck a deal with the Tripoli government to export oil in exchange for political concessions.However, the deal broke down earlier this year, leading to a halt in oil exports and significant economic losses for the country. Haftar's seizure of the terminals is likely to complicate efforts to restart exports and could lead to further fighting in the region.The move also underscores the growing power of Haftar, who has been accused of human rights abuses and of trying to undermine the Tripoli government. Haftar has rejected the authority of the government, calling for new elections and vowing to take control of the country.The situation in Libya remains highly volatile, with various factions vying for control of territory and resources.

They argue that they cannot provide adequate care to patients without adequate resources.This latest strike follows a similar one in March, which lasted over a month and had a devastating impact on the country's healthcare system. Some doctors have threatened to resign if their demands are not met, further exacerbating the shortage of medical personnel in the country.The Zimbabwean government has so far refused to meet the doctors' demands, citing a lack of funds. However, critics argue that the government has prioritized other projects over healthcare, including funding a luxury hotel for African Union delegates.The ongoing strike has put further strain on an already struggling healthcare system, with patients left without access to crucial services. It also highlights the wider economic challenges facing Zimbabwe, which has been beset by political instability and corruption for decades.As the strike continues, there are fears that the situation will only get worse, with patients and doctors alike suffering as a result.

The Chadians had been praised for their ability to operate in tough terrain and for their strong relationship with local communities.Many fear that the departure of the Chadian forces could lead to a power vacuum in the areas where they were stationed, which could be exploited by armed groups. There are also concerns that the withdrawal could lead to a spill-over of violence into neighboring countries, such as Chad and Sudan.The decision by Chad to withdraw its troops was reportedly prompted by a dispute with the CAR government over the use of Chadian forces to protect President Faustin-Archange Touadéra. The government had reportedly been insisting that the Chadians leave the country, leading to a breakdown in relations.The UN and other international organizations have called on all parties to work towards a peaceful solution to the crisis in the CAR, which has been wracked by violence and instability for years.

South Sudan, which relies heavily on its oil reserves, has accused Sudan of confiscating its oil and blocking exports through Sudanese pipelines, while Sudan has accused South Sudan of supporting rebel groups within its borders.The meeting comes amid renewed efforts by the African Union to mediate the long-standing dispute between the two countries. In January, the AU launched a new initiative aimed at resolving the conflict, which has led to years of violence and instability along their shared border.The last time the two presidents met was in January 2018, in the Ethiopian capital, where they agreed to work towards resolving their differences and improving relations.

However, his party still holds a comfortable majority in parliament, and there are few viable challengers to his leadership within the LDP.Abe's administration has focused on revitalizing the Japanese economy through a program of fiscal stimulus and structural reforms known as \"Abenomics.\" While the program has had some success in boosting growth and reducing unemployment, critics argue that it has not done enough to address long-term challenges such as an aging population and sluggish productivity.Despite his critics, Abe is seen as a skilled political operator with a strong support base within the LDP. His tenure has also been marked by a more assertive foreign policy, including efforts to strengthen Japan's defense capabilities and forge closer ties with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.If Abe does win an extended term as LDP leader, he will have the opportunity to continue pursuing his policy agenda and to shape Japan's political landscape for years to come.

The landmark decision aims to protect the privacy of citizens in the digital age.In a 5-4 ruling, the court decided that accessing cellphone location data without a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The decision comes after several lower courts upheld the practice, citing a legal precedent from the 1970s that allowed police to obtain information from telephone companies without a warrant.The case involved Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbery based in part on cellphone location data that was obtained without a warrant. Carpenter argued that the data was obtained illegally, as it revealed his location at the time of the crime without his consent.The court's decision is a significant victory for privacy advocates, who argue that the government's ability to track citizens' movements through their cellphones is a violation of their rights. It also sets a precedent for future cases involving digital privacy and the use of technology in law enforcement.However, the ruling is expected to have a significant impact on law enforcement efforts, as police officers will now need to obtain a warrant before accessing cellphone location data. This could delay investigations and make it harder for law enforcement to catch suspects.Overall, the decision highlights the ongoing debate over privacy and technology in the digital age, and raises important questions about how best to balance security with individual rights.",

The men, who were all in their early 20s, were found guilty of planning an attack on a crowded public place in the UK.The men were arrested in June 2018 after a joint operation between the police and MI5. They were found to have purchased weapons and explosives, and had carried out reconnaissance of potential targets.During their trial, the court heard that the men had been inspired by ISIS propaganda and had planned to carry out a large-scale attack. Their targets included landmarks and transport hubs in London.The judge described the men's actions as \"chilling\" and \"calculated\". He said that their intentions were clear and that they posed a serious threat to public safety.The men will serve a minimum of 30 years in prison before they can be considered for parole. The judge also imposed an order preventing the men from ever being released from prison if they are considered to be a continued danger to society.The sentencing marks the end of a long and complex investigation into the men's activities. The authorities have praised the work of the police and MI5 in preventing what could have been a catastrophic attack.",

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed voluntary guidelines for the industry to cut down on sodium levels in processed foods, which account for about 80% of the salt that Americans consume. Studies have linked excessive salt intake to hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. However, critics argue that this move might lead to a reduction in taste and consumer satisfaction.

Despite efforts to improve the education system, students still struggle to receive quality education due to these issues.One of the major problems facing West African schools is a lack of funding. Many schools are underfunded and unable to provide basic resources such as textbooks, stationery, and equipment. This often results in overcrowded classrooms where students are forced to share resources, and teachers are unable to provide individual attention to all students.Corruption also plays a significant role in the state of West African schools. Funds meant for educational purposes are often diverted to personal accounts, leaving schools with even fewer resources. Teachers may also demand bribes from students in exchange for good grades, which further undermines the quality of education.Overcrowding is another major issue plaguing West African schools. The number of students in each class is often way beyond what is reasonable, making it difficult for students to learn effectively. This is compounded by a lack of teachers, which further exacerbates the problem.In conclusion, the state of West African schools remains a cause for concern as students continue to face significant challenges. To ensure that students receive quality education, governments need to prioritize funding for education, stamp out corruption and implement policies that reduce overcrowding. Until these issues are adequately addressed, students in West Africa will continue to struggle to receive the education they deserve.",

These weather events will have devastating effects on communities around the world, particularly in areas that are already struggling with poverty and lack of resources.The report also warns of the impact on food production, as changing weather patterns and extreme weather events disrupt crop yields and make it more difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed the world's growing population.In addition to these environmental and humanitarian impacts, climate change will also have serious economic consequences. The report notes that we can expect increased damage to infrastructure, higher insurance costs, and reduced economic productivity as a result of extreme weather events.It's clear that urgent action is needed to address the threat of climate change. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We need to invest in renewable energy, promote energy efficiency, and change our consumption patterns to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.The impacts of climate change are coming sooner and faster than we thought, but it's not too late to take action.

The central bank raised its repo rate, the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks, by 25 basis points to 6.5%, citing concerns over rising oil prices and uncertainty over global trade.India's inflation rate currently stands at 5%, which is above the RBI's target of 4%. The central bank hopes that higher interest rates will encourage people to save more money rather than spend it, which in turn could help to ease inflationary pressures.The move comes at a time when India is facing a number of economic challenges, including a widening current account deficit, a weakening rupee, and rising fuel prices. Some analysts have expressed concern that the rate hikes could further slow down economic growth, which has already been hampered by the impact of a series of reforms implemented by the government.However, others argue that higher interest rates are necessary in order to bring inflation under control and stabilize the economy in the long term. As RBI Governor Urjit Patel noted in a recent statement, \"The risks to the inflation outlook are clearly tilted to the upside…we cannot afford to be complacent.\"This latest hike in interest rates is likely to have an impact on a range of sectors, including consumer loans, mortgages, and business borrowing. Whether or not it will ultimately succeed in curbing inflation and stabilizing the economy remains to be seen, but for now, it appears that India's central bank is willing to take some tough measures in order to tackle these economic challenges.",

He cited examples from previous global crises, including the 2008 financial crisis and the Ebola outbreak in 2014, where cuts to development aid resulted in long-term consequences for the affected regions.The COVID-19 pandemic has already disrupted global economies and caused countries to redirect their resources towards emergency response measures. The World Bank estimates that the pandemic could push up to 60 million people into extreme poverty, with Africa and South Asia being hit the hardest. In his article, Gates warned that further cuts to development aid could exacerbate these challenges and have lasting effects on vulnerable communities.Gates acknowledged the economic challenges that countries are facing but stressed that investing in global health and development is essential for both humanitarian and economic reasons. He cited studies that have shown how investments in health and education can help reduce poverty and spur economic growth.The billionaire also called on philanthropists and businesses to step up their support for global health and development programs during these difficult times. He argued that their contributions, combined with government aid, could help mitigate the impact of the pandemic and ensure that progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is not reversed.As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates's warning serves as a reminder that investing in global health and development is more critical than ever.

The strike, which began on Monday, is in protest of rising diesel fuel prices.The agricultural belt is responsible for a significant portion of Brazil's food production, including soybeans and corn. With the strike affecting transportation, farmers have been unable to transport their products to markets and ports for export.The strike has also caused fuel shortages in some areas, as trucks carrying fuel are unable to reach their destinations. Long lines have formed at gas stations, with some running out of fuel altogether.The Brazilian government has attempted to negotiate with the truckers, offering a 10% reduction in diesel fuel prices and other incentives. However, the truckers have refused the offer and continue to strike.The strike is causing widespread concern among the Brazilian population, as food shortages could lead to increased prices and potential social unrest. The government is urging the truckers to end the strike and return to negotiations.As of now, there is no clear end in sight for the truckers' strike, and its impact on Brazil's economy and food production is yet to be determined.",

The move comes after the Biden administration imposed sanctions on Russian officials and businesses in response to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.The proposed sanctions are aimed at punishing Russia for its alleged interference in the 2020 US presidential election, its role in the SolarWinds cyberattack, and its aggressive behavior towards Ukraine.The sanctions would target Russian officials, businesses, and financial institutions, and could include restrictions on trade and investment.\"The United States must stand up to this menace and take strong action to hold Russia accountable for its reckless and destabilizing behavior,\" said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, one of the lawmakers leading the effort to impose sanctions.The move is likely to further strain US-Russia relations, which have already been rocky for years. The two countries have been at odds over a range of issues, including Russia's annexation of Crimea, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and its military intervention in Syria.The proposed sanctions are likely to face opposition from some US businesses, which have lobbied against similar measures in the past. But proponents say they are necessary to protect US national security and send a message to Russia that its behavior will not be tolerated.The Biden administration has not yet commented on the proposed sanctions, but has said that it will take a tough line on Russia. \"The United States will respond to a number of destabilizing actions that Russia has taken,\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this month.If the proposed sanctions are approved, they would represent a significant escalation in US-Russian tensions, and could lead to further retaliation from Moscow. But some analysts say that the threat of sanctions alone could be enough to deter Russia from further aggressive actions.",

The plaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages in order to deter similar behavior in the future.In response to the lawsuit, the California Catholic Conference issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and vowing to cooperate fully with authorities.\"We take all allegations of sexual abuse seriously and are committed to addressing them swiftly and justly,\" the statement read. \"We will work closely with law enforcement to ensure that any perpetrators are brought to justice and that victims receive the support they need.\"The Catholic Church has been rocked by a series of sex abuse scandals in recent years, with victims coming forward to share their stories and demand accountability from church officials.

The decision was made after several high-profile incidents involving private security firms and their personnel, which resulted in loss of civilian lives and damage to public property.Afghanistan has been plagued by insecurity and conflict for decades, with the Taliban and other armed groups carrying out frequent attacks on civilians and security forces. Private security firms, which have been operating in the country since the US-led invasion in 2001, were intended to provide additional security for foreign embassies, aid organizations, and businesses.However, the firms have faced criticism for their lack of accountability and transparency, and have been accused of operating with impunity, committing human rights abuses, and fueling corruption. The move to abolish them is seen as a major step towards bringing the security situation under control and restoring public trust in the government.The decision has been welcomed by some, who argue that the firms have contributed to the instability in the country, while others have raised concerns about the impact on the thousands of personnel working for the firms, who will be left without jobs. The government has said that it will work to find alternative employment for those affected.The move comes at a critical time for Afghanistan, as the country prepares for peace talks with the Taliban, which are set to begin in Qatar in the coming weeks. The talks are seen as a crucial step towards ending the conflict, which has ravaged the country for years and claimed the lives of thousands of people.As the government moves to implement the ban on private security firms, it remains to be seen how effective it will be in improving the security situation in the country and restoring public confidence in the government's ability to provide security.",

The agency, which provides assistance to more than 5 million Palestinian refugees in the Middle East, is calling on donors to contribute $1.4 billion to help it maintain its vital services.The funding shortfall is a result of a number of factors, including a reduction in funding from some of the agency's traditional donors and a significant increase in the number of refugees it is serving. In recent years, the number of Palestinian refugees in the region has risen sharply, largely due to the ongoing conflict in Syria.The UNRWA has warned that without urgent funding, it will be forced to scale back its services, which include education, healthcare, and food assistance. This would have a devastating impact on the millions of refugees who rely on the agency's support.The UNRWA is one of the longest-running relief agencies in the world, having been established in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees who were displaced from their homes during the Arab-Israeli conflict. Today, it operates in five countries, including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The agency has called on the international community to step up and support its work. In a statement, the UNRWA's Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, said: \"We urgently need the support of our donors to allow us to continue providing assistance to those who need it most.",

The attack took place in the city of Gwadar in Balochistan province, where the engineers were working on a hydroelectric project as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The bomber reportedly rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into the bus carrying the engineers, causing a powerful blast. The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad has strongly condemned the attack and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but separatist militants in Balochistan have been targeting Chinese projects in the area, alleging that they are exploiting local resources and depriving the Baloch people of their rights.

In announcing the actions, the president pointed to a new report detailing the continuing rise in the cost of higher education in the United States.In his remarks at the University of Colorado at Denver, the president used a personal example and some humor to illustrate the pressures that sharply rising education costs place on Americans.The president recalled the burden that he and his wife Michelle struggled with in paying off about $120,000 in student loans after they graduated from law school.\"We combined and got poorer together. We combined our liabilities not our assets. So we were paying more on our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month,\" he said.Obama pointed to a new report from the College Board showing that the average tuition at private colleges in the United States went up by more than 4 percent - 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges - during the past year. That's faster than inflation and income growth.One step the president announced will allow college graduates enrolled in an existing government program to pay back student loans at a maximum rate equal to 10 percent of their disposable income, rather than 15 percent, and be eligible for debt forgiveness on their remaining debt in 20 years instead of 25.Another rule change would help students consolidate multiple loans into one federally-backed loan at a lower interest rate, allowing them to save more money.",

A referendum for independence from Indonesia set off a wave of violence by anti-independence militias that left the small island territory a blackened, smoldering ruin.After two and one-half years under United Nations administration, East Timor will get its first democratically elected president in April and gain full independence in May.But the attention span of the world is short.

However, there is concern that trouble between the two countries could impede efforts to re-establish government control over the northeast, much of which is still under the control of the ex-Seleka rebel coalition. The news that Chad is withdrawing troops from the peacekeeping force in the C.A.R. came as a surprise Thursday. As it filtered through the streets of Bangui, many nodded in approval. A man said it was a wish come true because Chad has meddled in the C.A.R.'s affairs too much over the past two decades. Others said Chad's involvement in this ongoing crisis has simply grown too controversial. He said Chadian troops kept being implicated in too many incidents hurting civilians and they were accused of abuses in the interior of the country. He said even when they did good, it was misinterpreted. \"They are always accused of being pro-Muslim and that causes problems,\" so he said, \"it is better they just go.\" In Bangui, it is not uncommon to hear people use the terms Chadian, Muslim and Seleka interchangeably. In a Muslim part of town, the PK5 neighborhood, people said Chad's departure was \"a little worrying.\" A man said the anti-balaka militia were afraid of Chad. He said \"they know if Chad iss there, they can't attack us.\" Chad's Foreign Ministry, in its statement withdrawing its peacekeepers, said \"despite the sacrifices made, Chad and Chadians are the target of a gratuitous and malicious campaign blaming them for all the suffering\" of the C.A.R.

The government's five-party coalition closed ranks against opposition accusations of economic mismanagement and a heated debate over national sovereignty. As Ron Corben reports from Bangkok, a senior minister also discounted any moves of a cabinet reshuffle after the vote. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his cabinet had faced accusations of economic mismanagement and of disregarding Thailand's national sovereignty. After three days of feisty debate on the no-confidence motion, the vote highlighted the unity of the five-party coalition government. The president of the parliament, Chai Chidchob, announced the final tally. He says Mr. Samak received 280 votes, and that there were 162 votes in favor of the no-confidence motion. The opposition has accused Mr. Samak of being unable to manage his government. The commerce minister came under fire over his handling of the country's rice industry. Rice prices have risen sharply over recent months adding to the pain the middle class and poor are suffering because of high fuel prices. The opposition also said Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama and the rest of the government acted in haste in an agreement with Cambodia over an ancient temple on the Thai-Cambodian border.",

John Hickenlooper, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep.

But I also believe, and it is personal, and I was actually very — it was hurtful, to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.”Biden hit back: “It’s a mischaracterization of my position across the board: I did not praise racists. That is not true.”Sanders was pressed over his self-description as a socialist, including a question on whether his proposals like Medicare for All would lead to higher taxes on the middle class.“Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for,” he said, arguing that insurance premiums would be lower under his proposal.",

The trend has been driven by industrial overfishing, coupled with surging demand, largely from Japan, which consumes 80 percent of the world's supply. The prized bluefin tuna is usually served as sashimi or sushi.In 1969, the International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tunas was charged with setting quotas and managing healthy tuna populations.

The priest, who is deceased, arrived at St. Anthony Claret Catholic Church in Anaheim in the early 1970s from Chicago, according to the lawsuit.Attorney Jeff Anderson, center, holds photographs of clergy accused of sexual abuse, next to abuse survivor Tom Emens, second from left, Oct. 2, 2018, in Los Angeles.\"This lawsuit is to find justice -- to get the clerics at the top to come clean and tell the truth,'' Emens said.Attorney Jeff Anderson said the goal of the so-called nuisance lawsuit is to force the church to reveal the names of all priests accused of child molestation. He said church documents would reveal a playbook among bishops and other officials to protect offending clergy by keeping files under wraps and moving the priests across the country and, in some cases, out of the U.S.The lawsuit asks a judge \"to abate the continuing nuisance'' of abuse by ordering each diocese to name all accused priests, detail their history of alleged assault and identify their last known addresses.The California Catholic Conference of Bishops, which oversees the state's 12 dioceses, didn't directly address the lawsuit in a statement Tuesday afternoon.",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",

And, there have been cases of contractor abuse ranging from violence to cultural insensitivity that have given the private security industry a bad name among many Afghans.Karzai set this month as the deadline for private security firms to be replaced with the interior ministry's new Afghan Private Protection Force or APPF.

A preliminary session revealed differences of opinion on the best path to growth.The ministerial conference being held over the next week is based on the premise that Africa has the potential to become a pole of global growth. But experts say growth has been stymied in the past by persistent economic imbalances, driven partially by high levels of borrowing and debt.Two senior economists briefing reporters Wednesday agreed that past policies aimed at fostering development have had mixed results. Particular criticism has been leveled at what has come to be known as the Washington Consensus.The Washington Consensus is generally defined as a set of late 20th century policy prescriptions advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Those prescriptions emphasized the efficiency of private enterprise and open markets.Many African governments blame those market-oriented policies for the continent's economic stagnation in the 1970s and 80s.Last year's ministerial conference was devoted to examining the state's role in development, and this conference will hear reports based on the results of that meeting.Comments Wednesday by African Union Economic Affairs Commissioner Maxwell Mkwazelamba and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Deputy Chief Abdallah Hamdok revealed that the issue is far from settled.Hamdok argues that recent experience shows economies that have developed fastest have been those where the state has taken the dominant role.

He helped develop the hand in a lab backed by the Italian Institute of Technology and the INAIL state workers' compensation prosthetic center.The Hennes has only one motor that controls all five fingers, making it lighter, cheaper and more able to adapt to the shape of objects.\"This can be considered low-cost because we reduce to the minimum the mechanical complexity to achieve, at the same time, a very effective grasp, and a very effective behavior of the prosthesis,\" De Michieli said. \"We maximized the effectiveness of the prosthetics and we minimized the mechanical complexity.\"They plan to bring it to market in Europe next year with a target price of around 10,000 euros ($11,900), about 30 percent below current market prices.Arun Jayaraman,a robotic prosthetic researcher at the Shirley Ryan Ability lab in Chicago, said the lighter design could help overcome some resistance in users to the myoelectric hands, which to date have been too heavy for some. Italian researchers say the Hennes weighs about the same as a human hand.In the United States, many amputees prefer the much simpler hook prosthetic, which attaches by a shoulder harness, because it allows them to continue to operate heavy equipment, Jayaraman said.Italian retiree Marco Zambelli has been testing the Hennes hand for the last three years.",

To make matters worse the rains have started early, making distribution more difficult and more costly. “In the Central African Republic where you have no all-weather roads, when the rains begin, it means that we can no longer distribute by road,” Cousin says.

Democrats need a net total of 23 to assume the House majority, which would likely derail Republican President Donald Trump's policy agenda.The polls closed at 8 p.m. and final results were expected within hours. Voters in the state were also choosing Republican nominees to take on incumbent Governor Tom Wolf and U.S. Senator Bob Casey, both Democrats.Pennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the state Supreme Court found that the current congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans. The redrawn map has made some districts more competitive.In addition, six incumbent House Republicans are not running for re-election, further scrambling the races and requiring voters to become familiar with a raft of first-time candidates.81 candidates for 18 seatsSome 81 candidates are running for 18 congressional seats, including 10 Democrats in a single race.Democrats feel confident they can ultimately win three districts in suburban Philadelphia regardless of which candidates win their primaries on Tuesday because of the liberal tilt of those areas.A more interesting contest comes in the northeastern district being vacated by retiring Representative Charlie Dent, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the House.A historical marker in Allentown, Pennsylvania, May 5, 2018.",

Our correspondent reports the attempt renews tensions between protesters and law enforcement.?This is god**** our park! This is our park! The real people?s park! It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential. He adds that the act of human beings assembling in a public space to talk politics, exchange ideas and to play music has become an exotic luxury.",

The tap-dancing extravaganza, about a chorus girl turned big star, will tour six other Chinese cities this year.This Broadway production is the first to have such an extensive touring scheduled in China and many more blockbuster musicals are expected to follow.Broadway musicals - showcasing a lot of dancing and singing - are finding their way into theaters that have previously only showed traditional Chinese opera and patriotic dramas. Last year, Chinese audiences saw \"West Side Story\", \"The Sound of Music\" and \"The Lion King\".U.S. producers and promoters say China's market liberalization and growing prosperity are fueling demand for Western theater.Chris Verrill directs a local production of another Tony-award winner \"Guys and Dolls\" at the Beijing Playhouse. \"The next big thing that grows after the economy is the arts.

I write with songwriters; I play with other good musicians,'' Starr told Reuters, noting \"because it's what I do.'' \"It's very hard for me to find a stranger these days because I've been around a long time.'' Starr has witnessed the music industry evolve dramatically over his 50-year career, and consumption is becoming increasingly digital with Apple Inc's iTunes and Amazon.com Inc as well as online streaming platforms such as Spotify and Jay Z's newly-announced Tidal. The Beatles famously abstained from going digital until 2010, when its entire back catalog became available exclusively on iTunes. Starr himself still prefers purchasing physical copies of music. \"Streaming I don't understand anymore. All I ever hear is that your record has been streamed 17 million times and they give you a check for 12 bucks,'' he said. \"With the established musicians, that seems to be the problem.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union says its Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians is investigating the cases of 311 MPs from 41 countries - a 13 percent increase over 2013.The data reveal 38 percent of the MPs who faced governmental abuse are from Africa, 25 percent from Asia, 18 percent from the Middle East and North Africa, 14 percent from the Americas and five percent from Europe.IPU human rights program manager Rogier Huizenga said the three worst cases in Africa were Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Eritrea. They represent 21.5 percent of abuse cases on the continent.“DRC - there are a number of serious cases where due process is a concern, where freedom of expression is a concern. Eritrea is the famous case of the G-11, the members of parliament who wrote a critical letter to the authorities, to the president, Afwerki, 2001, and were taken away in September that year and were never seen again. And, then the case in Zambia where there are concerns about the use of the Public Order Act and the limitations that that brings along for the right to freedom of assembly,” said Huizenga.In Asia, the IPU cites 78 MPs from 12 countries who are under threat.It singles out the Maldives as the worst violator.",

At a meeting in Berlin, leaders from eight European countries called for regulating financial markets and hedge funds, investment funds that typically lead to aggressive financial strategies.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit, said all financial markets, products and participants that pose a major risk must be regulated.Ms. Merkel also called for world economies to coordinate in establishing sanctions for tax shelters and regions where financial deals are opaque.The European meeting comes ahead of a London summit on the international crisis in early April of the so-called G-20 nations, the world's top economic powers. But it is unclear whether the Europeans' call for widespread regulation will be well received by other G-20 members, which include the United States, China, Japan and several developing nations.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the European leaders had also agreed on the need to shore up international institutions like the World Bank, including in their role in helping the poorest nations.\"We decided that the international institutions should have at least $500 billion to enable them not just to deal with crises, but to enable them to be able to prevent crises,\" said Gordon Brown.",

The investigators say the soldiers were likely on a mission to evacuate Muslims from a volatile area. Information gathered by the U.N. investigation team shows soldiers from the Chadian national army entered the C.A.R. capital, Bangui, in several pick-up vehicles on March 29. The investigators say the soldiers went to the neighborhood known as PK12, one of two main districts where thousands of Muslims are virtually trapped. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville says several sources have told the investigating team the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants. He says the soldiers apparently were trying to save these people from attacks by Christian anti-balaka militia. “As soon as the convoy of the Chadian National Army reached the PK12 market area around 3:00 p.m., it allegedly opened fire on the population without any provocation. As people fled in all directions in panic, the soldiers continued to fire indiscriminately. At the time of the shooting, the market was full of many people, including many young girls and women buying and selling produce,\" said Colville.

Tribal leaders are able to maintain this power in part because they are often themselves government representatives and/or religious leaders.“The tribal system has been politicized and the tribes no longer cooperate with each other,” said Abdulbasit Al-Mashwali, a leader of the Yemeni Parliamentarians Union, a government watchdog group in Sana’a. “In the past they filled a humanitarian role, but not anymore. Now it's all political bickering.”The tribal system was officially abandoned with the overthrow of the Imamate in 1962, but the governments that followed kept it in place unofficially, according to Abdulrahman al-Marwani, who heads the Dar Al-Salam, a human rights advocacy group in Sana'a.“For half a century governments have been handing over the nation’s wealth to the tribal leaders,” he said. “And the tribal leaders also get money from foreign sources to pressure the state’s political decisions.”Yemeni tribesmen await remains of one of their own killed in clashes, Khawlan al-Tyal, a tribal area east of Sana'a, September 2015.

From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo has more.The CD was compiled by Dave Segal, Lucky Dube's sound engineer from the moment he launched his career until his death.Dube launched his career by singing traditional Zulu music, called mbaqanga. He recorded his first album with the Super Soul band in 1982. He then swapped genres and seemed to find his own voice in reggae, producing \"Rastas Never Die\". The song ended up being banned by the former apartheid government of South Africa.Dube was one of a handful of performers and artists who openly called for the end of the whites-only regime. His 1989 hit \"Together As One\" asked why racial segregation remained if so many hated it. He sang that while cats and dogs seemed to be able to forgive one another, people - who claim to be the most advanced of species - seemed unable to do so.For decades Dube continued to sing about injustice. After the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, he sang about corruption and the tax collector, who seemed to take a large slice of hard working people's income.",

The line of credit, announced Monday, comes at a time when Zimbabwe has no access to international lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe needs at least $4 billion in lines of credit so its struggling industries can get back on their feet. Speaking after the signing ceremony for the Botswana credit facility, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti outlined the rise and fall of his country's economy. \"In 1996 we were the second largest economy in the SADC [Southern African Development Community],\" said Biti. \"In 2012 we are marginally higher than Malawi, marginally higher than Lesotho, marginally higher than Swaziland. Let us put our house in order.\" Biti has repeatedly criticized government policies of seizing white-owned farmland and \"indigenzing\" foreign-owned companies to give a majority stake to black Zimbabweans. Those policies crippled farm production and scared away investors. As a result, the economy has struggled for more than a decade, and the country‘s external debt is now about $10 billion. Biti said he hopes other countries will follow Botswana in extending credit lines to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe cannot get credit from lenders like the IMF and the World Bank since it defaulted on loans from those organizations about a decade ago. The Botswana credit facility is being bankrolled by commercial banks who get a guarantee from the Gaborone government. This follows an appeal from SADC leaders to make funds available to help Zimbabwe's industries recover.",

For unemployed workers from South Asia, that is sometimes not an option. In Dubai's hey day, the sound of construction was everywhere. High rises and tourist resorts were built by legions of foreign workers, most of them from India and Pakistan. Dubai became an international magnet, reinventing itself as a financial capital and tourist mecca in the Persian Gulf. Then the global crisis reached this outpost and boom turned into bust.Now, these men - like thousands of others - are out of work.

He came to the United Arab Emirates two years ago, but says he recently lost his job. And, now, without money coming in, life is hard.\"No money for the foods [sic], everything is so expensive, medicine and rents,\" said Abbasi.These men were among the army of foreign laborers that built Dubai when the economy was booming. Many have been unemployed for more than a month. They say they cannot return home because their employers are holding their passports and have ordered them to wait until work picks up.More than half of the construction projects in the United Arab Emirates, worth $582 billion, have been put on hold, according to the market research firm, Proleads.

The Swiss humanitarian agency says an explosion of conflict and violence, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, is threatening regional stability and putting development prospects of impoverished countries at risk.The International Committee of the Red Cross says the nature of armed conflict is changing. ICRC President Peter Maurer said new kinds of crises are emerging, in new combinations, often with a regional dimension. “We are not anymore in a situation where we have a clear cut international or internal armed conflicts with clear cut front lines and positions unfolding in front of us. We see international armed conflict, internal armed conflict, criminal violence, inter-communal violence, super-positioning itself in the same context,” he said.Maurer said the conflict in Syria has long ceased to be a civil war. It has become a regional crisis engulfing Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said extremism is deepening some of the conflicts being waged, leading to increasingly violent behavior.“Two-hundred thousand people have been killed since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, 9200 civilians have been killed since the beginning of this year in Iraq.

The auction of Gandhi's belongings became embroiled in controversy following outrage and opposition in India. Culture and Tourism Minister Ambika Soni congratulated the people of India and said the government is happy that Mahatma Gandhi's heritage \"to which we are emotionally bonded\" has been saved.An Indian businessman, Vijay Mallya, successfully bid for the items of the Indian independence leader for $1.8 million in New York after frantic efforts by the Indian government to stop the controversial auction failed. His representative says the items have been bought for India. The items include Gandhi's trademark wire-rimmed spectacles, a brass bowl and plate, worn leather sandals and a pocket watch. Gandhi is a national icon who inspired millions of Indians to join a non-violent struggle against British rule.

Here's a look at some of the claims we've examined:MS-13 Trump: \"We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.\"The facts: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in a speech this week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ``and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members.'' On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ``our partners in Central America.'' That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. Opioids Trump: Changes in immigration policies, including more border security, ``will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.''The facts: Drugs being brought across borders are only part of the problem contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention, about 40 percent of the opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some are abused by the people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market.

Last week Pakistani security forces directly confronted Taliban militants in mountainous areas just 100 kilometers from the capital. Airstrikes and artillery barrages effectively ended months of negotiations to try to avoid violence by establishing Islamic law in parts of the northwest.Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University says the Talibans rapid advance towards the capital was a wake-up call for the government. \"The fact is the situation is grim,\" Hoodbhoy said. \"The fact is that the Taliban have made enormous inroads into the country.

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be? I am certain it will be John's.''Said House Speaker Paul Ryan, ``His legacy is so long that John McCain is a hero to us all.''",

The number of families facing similar problems will balloon as the population ages at a rate among the fastest in Southeast Asia.Thailand's working-age population is expected to shrink by 11 percent by 2040.The rising cost of care is an additional burden to households struggling with record debt that is a drag on consumption and stunting the economy.\"I struggled for months and it took a while to adjust,\" said Supapan, who lives in Nonthaburi province, just north of the capital, Bangkok.Looking after her father costs at least 15,000 baht ($430) a month, she said, a little less than half what she earns.A culture of filial piety in which families feel obliged to care for their elderly means more often than not they absorb the expense of looking after parents and grandparents.A poor savings culture has left many people ill-prepared to help themselves financially in old age, meaning they must rely on working family members.More than a quarter of the 66 million population has not saved for old age, according to a 2014 survey, one of many factors contributing to the government considering raising the age of retirement from 60 and urging businesses to hire more older people.\"",

In December, international negotiators will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a new U.N. treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, the climate change agreement that expires in 2012. In advance of that meeting, the United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] has released a new science report that underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for governments to act. The UNEP report presents scientific evidence that has emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its last report in 2007. The \"Climate Change Science Compendium\" affirms that climate change is accelerating faster than previous estimates. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner says evidence of human-generated warming is \"unequivocal\" and \"just in time for us to appreciate how the magnitude of change, the scale of change and the pace of change are in fact occurring.\"Findings from some 400 peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals and research institutes are woven into the report's chapters on earth systems, ecosystems, ice, oceans and climate management. The data show that global carbon emissions - which rose 1.1 percent from 1990 to 1999 - climbed 3.5 percent from 2000-2007. Rapid glacier-melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification will become complex problems, Steiner says, in a world whose population is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. \"And herein lies another vital message in the report,\" he says.",

While people are still worried about the extent of drug abuse, especially in their schools and neighborhoods, those surveyed supported less harsh punishment for non-violent offenders, especially marijuana users, the Pew Research Center found. Among the 1,821 U.S. adults polled, 67 percent said they backed treatment for drug users compared to 26 percent who said the government should focus on prosecution. Another 7 percent said they did not know what to focus on. Two thirds also said they supported the growing movement among some U.S. states to back away from mandatory sentences for minor drug crimes, according to the nonpartisan group's survey. In comparison, less than half of those polled in 2001 backed reduced prison time. \"The public appears ready for a truce in the long-running war on drugs,\" Pew researchers wrote. The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 through Feb. 23, comes as policy makers and top U.S. law enforcement officials reexamine the nation's drug policy to allow judges greater discretion in sentencing offenders, although some prosecutors have balked at the effort. The Obama administration has endorsed reducing prison sentences in federal drug cases, an idea some Republicans also endorse. Lawmakers in Congress in both political parties are also revisiting the issue.",

For example, a Snapchat video by clubgoer Amanda Alvear that accidentally captured the first moments of gunfire inside the club quickly went viral, even before major news outlets began reporting on the attack.Increasingly, especially in times of tragedy and trauma, social researchers say people turn to their online communities for news, for solace, to share painful experiences of confusion and sadness, and reach out to friends for emotional support and counsel.Nothing about the Internet is purely good or bad, and those same social networks that can help bring people together can also often be used to drive them apart. In this instance, it took almost no time for acrimonious fights to start over placing the blame, the threats of Islamist terrorism, gun control, presidential politics and LGBT rights.So, is social media a help or a hindrance in times of crisis and tragedy? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is both.“With social media, we can now connect with millions of people, including strangers, remotely,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi, a business psychology professor at University College London and Columbia University. “Such a connection is mostly digital, but human imagination enables us to experience empathy, what other people feel, even when they are far away and we don’t know them.”",

The system's ability to intercept enemy missiles fills a gap in the current missile defense system deployed on the Korean Peninsula.The deployment, however, has encountered strong opposition from China, which is concerned that THAAD will undermine the strategic deterrence of China's long- and mid-range missiles, as well as the regional military balance.FILE - People watch a TV screen showing a file footage of a missile launch conducted by North Korea, at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, March 18, 2016.Rose also said the United States understands China's concerns, and has always hoped to explain that the deployment will not affect China's strategic deterrent.\"THAAD's single-stage interceptors deployed in [South Korea] would not have the range or capability to intercept Chinese ICBMs headed to the United States,\" he said. \"It is pure physics.\"",

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Weimin said the islands, known as Huangyan in China, are an integral part of Chinese territory and that any Philippine claim to them is \"completely baseless.\"\"",

Western nations and regional neighbors accuse the North of using the launch as a ploy to test a ballistic missile that could later be fitted with a nuclear warhead.The U.N. chief repeated warnings that the launch, which is set to take place sometime between Thursday and Monday, will raise tensions in the region. He also said it \"clearly\" violates a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at reining in North Korea's nuclear weapons program.Meanwhile, military forces in South Korea and Japan were on high alert Thursday on what the North says is the first day of a five-day window for the launch.Any plans for a Thursday launch dimmed by mid-day with no sign of new activity at the launch pad outside a cloud-covered Pyongyang. In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated his nation's appeal for Pyongyang to cancel the launch but said Japanese forces are ready to shoot the rocket down if it strays over Japanese territory.\"In case it happens, we are on full alert.",

At the Women’s Mosque of America in Los Angeles, male worshippers older than 12 are excluded, making the new Berkeley mosque the first of its kind in the country.“We uplift the female, and just as the Prophet loved women, we must follow in his footsteps and love ourselves and each other,” she said.Keeble is a 40-something convert from Christianity with a master’s degree in religious leadership from the Starr King School of Ministry, a seminary affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, which has donated space for the mosque.At Qal’bu Maryam, there is no imam, as the cleric who conducts worship at a mosque is called. Rather, female lay leaders will rotate in leading the prayers and the talks.About 50 or so women and men, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, attended the jummah or traditional Friday service, listening to prayer leader Crystal Keshawarz chant the holy Arabic words, “God is great” or “Allahu Akbar.”",

How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers. “It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle,” said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.A pro-Russian man (not seen) holds a Russian flag behind an armed servicemen on top of a Russian army vehicle outside a Ukrainian border guard post in the Crimean town of Balaclava, March 1, 2014.Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich. But for the authorities in Kiev and local politicians still loyal to Ukraine, the rapid pace of events were evidence of a carefully orchestrated campaign from Moscow. Moscow denies any role in installing Aksyonov, who is known from his business days by the nickname “The Goblin”. But even those close to the Kremlin say Russia picked him. “Moscow always bet on Yanukovich. But after the coup in Kiev on Feb. 22 ... Moscow decided it needed to back the secession of Crimea from Ukraine.",

They had been expecting a more moderate increase.The Reserve Bank will now lend to banks at eight percent. Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao says with inflation running at more than nine percent, he has no other options. ?Inflation is expected to remain elevated for a few more months before moderating towards the later part of this year,\" says Subbarao. \"The challenge for the government and for the Reserve Bank is to ensure that demand is constrained in the short term to bring inflation down.?The surge in inflation was triggered by high food prices, which have jumped more than 10 percent in the last year and are hurting millions of poor people in the country. Hikes in fuel prices have led to a further spike in inflation. This is the 11th time that the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates since March of last year. The successive hikes have already begun dampening an economy which had been growing briskly at eight-and-a-half percent. However, the bank says there is no evidence of a sharp slowdown and expects growth to stay at eight percent.That optimism is not shared by most economists, who say that Asia?",

His father was a policeman and his mother was a homemaker. During his first 12 years, he moved five times throughout Bavaria as his father accepted various law enforcement positions.In 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Germany's Chancellor. In 1939, Ratzinger entered a seminary in Traunstein. And later that year, the World War II broke out.John Allen -- one of Ratzinger's biographers -- says soon after, he was forced to become a member of the Hitler Youth. \"In 1943, membership in the Hitler Youth became mandatory for anyone who was enrolled in a German school. So he was put on the books as a Hitler Youth member, but he never took part in it,\" says Allen. \"And in fact, he found a sympathetic teacher who allowed him to continue coming to classes, even though he didn't have his Hitler Youth card, which, in theory, all German youth were supposed to have.\"Allen says Ratzinger and his fellow seminarians were also pressed into part-time auxiliary military roles -- assigned to an anti-aircraft defense corps at a BMW munitions factory outside of Munich.

Mr. Obama has been waiting for the election dispute to be resolved before announcing his new war strategy. As the fighting continues to rage, U.S. officials stated repeatedly the election process had to be settled before President Barack Obama could make a reasoned decision about sending additional troops and resources to Afghanistan. Administration officials say the United States needs to make sure it has a credible partner in the Afghan government before any change in strategy. Analysts say the runoff election will add credibility to the new government and Mr. Obama applauded the move. \"President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think, have shown that they have the interests of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law and an insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done,\" said the president. Election officials are scrambling to organize the new ballot as the fierce Afghan winter approaches and the country faces a growing threat from the Taliban. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel has advised President Obama on Afghan policy. \"We have got to make sure that this second round is not marred by fraud and corruption like the first round,\" he said.
