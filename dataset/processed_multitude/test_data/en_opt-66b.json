The building is in an ethnically diverse, densely populated West London’s North Kensington area. Among those missing on Wednesday were a number of children.Witnesses said they heard screams for help as the fire stormed through the floors, trapping residents who could be seen from windows flashing their cell phone lights in hopes of being rescued. Witnesses said some residents held small children from windows while other people jumped from the lower stories of the building.?Watch video from the scene:Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Why did fire spread so quickly?",

Kim Hyun-hee has not appeared in such a high-profile way since 1991 - when she spoke to the South Korean public about an act of terrorism she was convicted of committing, four years earlier.

For that crime, she was sentenced to die, then given a South Korean presidential pardon.To fulfill her mission, Kim posed with another North Korean agent as a married Japanese couple.

It doesn't need one,\" David Ignatius suggests that we should try to stop all infectious diseases before they spread. Yet it is precisely because we are unable to stop all viruses that they remain important tools in our war against other diseases. For thousands of years, humans have fought against infectious diseases by developing a variety of vaccines. These vaccines work well because viruses tend to evolve in ways that make them safe from the antibodies they generate. This is a process called \"antigenic shift,\" which has allowed us to make vaccines for hundreds of deadly viruses.Mr. Ignatius's suggestion that we have no control over viral epidemics is simply wrong. In addition, this false suggestion may lead people to believe that we must be helpless in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet even without a vaccine, we can slow transmission in both the short and long term.

He said the surgery is properly carried out with a minimalist approach \"so that she is not hyper-sexually active. This is the purpose.\"Elsayed later issued a clarification through the mosque's website saying that \"Islam would never support anything that harms anybody's well-being\" and that he should have avoided his comments on hyper-sexuality.\"I hereby take it back. And I do apologize to all those who are offended by it,\" Elsayed wrote.Abdul-Malik says in his resignation that the board's actions against Elsayed are insufficient.\"Ultimately, The Board of Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center is responsible for the direction of the community and its leadership.",

        "text": "Article excerptCambodia's return to the international lending fold after its debt-relief programme expires next year has become highly contentious, as international donors debate whether to resume funding for the country's economic recovery.Many Western governments are concerned that Cambodia's government is seeking to return to power in elections due to be held by 2007, undermining political freedoms.A key concern is that the Cambodian government is seeking to gain economic leverage in the lead-up to the vote by re-writing the country's constitution to create a strong presidency.The US is now pushing back against the resumption of World Bank lending to Cambodia, claiming that its aid is being misused, in particular to prop up the royal family. Cambodia's leaders accuse the US of double standards, however, because the country has granted loans to other countries - including Egypt and Iraq - with questionable human rights records.On Thursday, Cambodia's government took a further step to distance itself from its Western creditors. Phnom Penh announced it was cancelling an aid deal with the UK that had promised to pay £15m to Cambodia's Red Cross.The Red Cross was to get two-thirds of the money but the rest was to be used to fund social programmes. Cambodia's National Assembly last week passed a law making the national government - rather than the NGOs - the legal owner of the country's NGOs, and the government said it was cancelling the deal because it feared a repeat of the 1999 collapse of the Cambodian Development Bank, when Western donors suspended aid to the country.In Washington, Cambodia's foreign minister, Hor Namhong, said he had little fear about the country's ability to survive the loss of Western aid. \"We will look to China, South Korea and other Asian countries,\" Mr Namhong told The Financial Times. He denied that Cambodia was seeking to re-write its constitution ahead of the elections as a way to give itself greater political influence. \"The government is not interested in maintaining its position. We are interested in strengthening democracy,\" he said.",

It says the new view will greatly help scientists understand solar storms that can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth. VOA's David McAlary reports.The new 3-D images came from twin NASA spacecraft named STEREO, launched last October. They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart. The separation provides a three dimensional view of the sun, just as the offset in our eyes gives us depth perception.Until the advent of this identical pair of observatories, images from Earth telescopes or orbiting solar telescopes were two dimensional. NASA solar scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta says the three dimensional images will help scientists determine where matter and energy flow in the sun's atmosphere much more precisely.\"We have to move away from the traditional sun-Earth line to view the sun from around, from over the poles, from under the poles to really get a deeper understanding of what is inside the sun, what is coming out of its surface, how is it affecting the entire solar system that we live in,\" said Madhulika Guhathakurta.The main STEREO project scientist, Michael Kaiser, says the satellites' depth perception will help improve space weather forecasts.Of particular concern are powerful eruptions of billions of tons of electrically charged gas that smash into Earth's magnetic field at millions of kilometers per hour.",

Ed Royce, R-Calif., (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)U.S. lawmakers reacted with outrage Thursday to Iran’s choice of a hard-line diplomat as its ambassador to the United Nations, saying it underscores the need to extend sanctions against the country to make it more difficult to conduct diplomacy.House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., called it “a cynical and perverse choice” that makes it “that much harder for Iran to lead by example” as it advocates “regime change” in other countries.Sen. James Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Iran’s selection of Mohammad Javad Zarif “undermines the international community’s desire to engage with Iran.” He said extending U.N. sanctions would send “a powerful signal” to Iran that its current policies are not acceptable.President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions that were eased under the 2015 accord.“The supreme leader and president chose to send a message to the world through this extremist choice: Iran is open for business, but only if you agree to do business with the supreme leader and his regime,” Engel said. “And if you don’t, Iran will punish you.”On Wednesday, a committee controlled by Iran’s parliament approved Zarif’s appointment. He has been foreign minister since 2013 under the administration of moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who handily won re-election to a second term last week. Rouhani’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, is considered a moderate within Iran’s clerically overseen political system.Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the U.S. and its allies have viewed Iran with suspicion, regarding its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, involvement in regional conflicts and support for militant groups.Zarif met last week with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Bangkok.",

Human Rights Commission reports at least three Afghans have died while resisting the forced eviction, and a number of women and children have been injured.The U.N. says it has received credible reports that in addition to these, at least six women were raped.The report also said that in several cases, Afghan authorities are alleged to have forcibly evicted people living in homes or land that they had previously given them permission to live on, or allow them to cultivate.The U.N. says the forced evictions, which started at the start of this year, have had a devastating impact on the local population in the Kandahar and neighboring Helmand provinces.The U.N. rights commission warns that the forced evictions are likely to have a profound effect on the security and political situation in Afghanistan, and it adds that they are in flagrant violation of Afghanistan's obligations under international human rights law.It says those evicted have been targeted solely on the basis of their being refugees from neighboring countries.",

It’s the result of the Ukrainian authorities’ policy, including on the issue of the Orthodox Church,” he added.Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, handed the tomos over to the head of the new Ukrainian Church, Metropolitan Epiphanius, during a solemn ceremony in Istanbul on Saturday.The tomos confirms the independence of the Ukrainian Church from the Russian Orthodox Church which dominated religious life in Ukraine for hundreds of years.It also formally appoints Epiphanius as the leader of the new church.“This independence will allow the Church of Ukraine to grow spiritually and to build relations with other local churches and other churches,” said President Petro Poroshenko, who attended the ceremony.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has been in dispute with Moscow for years over claims to churches and property, with Ukrainian authorities first granting its request to be made an autocephalous church in 1992.",

The \"shock and awe\" campaign started on March 20th with allied air strikes against leadership targets as US and British forces rolled across the border from Kuwait.On April 5th, American heavy armor penetrated Baghdad. And today, what fighting remains is largely mopping-up pockets of resistance as the U-S leads the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.How was the war won so quickly? And what are the lessons to be learned?Joining me to examine the Iraq war are: military strategist, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters; and military historian Victor Davis Hanson of California State University in Fresno, Califronia.Victor Hanson, let me begin with you. In your view, what was the key factor in the coalition victory in Iraq?MR. HANSON: I think it was the ability to start the ground war almost simultaneously with the air war that gave some tactical surprise, when it was hard to achieve surprise because of the past record in Afghanistan and Kosovo, where we didn't use sizeable numbers of ground troops. It saved the infrastructure. It undermined the Iraqi command-and-control. And it gave some powerful messages that we still could act without our allies, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia. We sort of envisioned the Iraqis -- the Baathists -- as a snake of sorts that was coiled around the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, and rather than just hacking at the coils, we went straight to Baghdad and tried to decapitate it.MR. MORALES: Ralph Peters, let me put that same question to you.MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with everything that has just been said as far as the operational factors go, but I think there is something even beyond that. This really was a civilizational victory.",

If that is possible with what we have here today, we will continue the current rate that we’re going out at.”U.S. military officials estimate that the force reductions scheduled to begin this summer should bring the U.S. troop strength in Iraq to just over 100,000 by this fall.",

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

The official predicted that China will accelerate work on its artificial islands once Donald Trump becomes U.S. president, but a full-blown military base is unlikely in the near future.“This is a pause, not a complete halt,” the official said on Saturday. “We will see more reclamation, we will see more militarization and airfield construction and a growing number of fighters, bombers, patrol planes, surveillance planes.”The Trump administration is expected to adopt a tougher stance on China’s claims in the South China Sea when he takes office Jan. 20, challenging Beijing to halt militarization of the strategic waterway and drawing closer to other nations with rival claims.The South China Sea is home to one of the world’s busiest seaways, and tensions between the U.S. and China over the disputed area have grown during President Barack Obama’s second term amid concerns over militarization. China’s reclamation in the region has stoked concern that other claimants such as Vietnam and the Philippines are vulnerable to domination by Beijing.Chinese government ships have been spotted this year removing floating structures at the disputed Scarborough Shoal after being deployed there by President Xi Jinping, the official said, adding that this was the first time the structure had been removed since the start of the standoff over the Scarborough Shoal in 2012.“This may signal a pause to what has been a fairly rapid expansion of the artificial-island base in the South China Sea,” the official said.According to the U.S. military, China has deployed radar equipment to the shoal and is building an airstrip on it that would allow military aircraft to land.At least two large radar units have been installed on Fiery Cross Reef, home to a Chinese military base, according to data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

He said “problems like poverty, unemployment and the huge gap between the coastal land cities and the inland spread despair among young Tunisians.”Meanwhile, Libya is a nation in chaos with two battling governments, scores of militias and a security vacuum being filled by a growing presence of the Islamic State extremist group on Tunisia's border.“Islamic State fighters took advantage of the political fragmentation in Libya to occupy the coastal city of Sirte and succeeded in bringing a large number of foreign fighters across the uncontrolled borders,” said Wafa Bugaighis, Libyan charge d’affaires in Washington. “Intelligence estimates state that there are between 5,000 and 7,000 IS fighters in Libya.\"",

What to do with a pair of dilapidated buildings on the edge of his property?Today Dinwiddie, who moved to this bucolic slice of far western France known as the Finistere more than a decade ago, has found the solution. Solar panels glisten from atop a now elegant stone veranda — Dinwiddie’s contribution to a larger energy transition.“We don’t use the electricity as such,” he said ruefully. “We sell it back into the energy grid, and buy it back at half the price from EDF… which is a bit crazy, really.”EDF, or Electricite de France, is France’s national power company, which operates the country’s 58 nuclear power plants, although it also has a renewable energy wing. But to install his solar panels, Dinwiddie turned to Quenea, one of dozens of local companies now mushrooming around the area.As negotiators from 195 nations try to reach a climate deal in Paris, regional and local governments aren’t waiting. Many are forging ahead with their own climate action plans that are sometimes more ambitious than national ones.“If you look at the delivery and implementation of what comes out of Paris, most will take place at the state, regional or city level,” said Libby Ferguson, state and regions director for UK nonprofit The Climate Group. On a local level, she said, “we’re already seeing some really substantial emissions cuts.”",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.

He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute.

The Santiago archbishopric said in a statement that Ricardo Ezzati had been summoned to speak with prosecutors on August 21 as a defendant accused of concealment. Prosecutors investigating criminal accusations against bishops, clerics and lay workers in the Roman Catholic Church in Chile are also probing claims that Ezzati and others covered up a network of 14 priests who systematically abused minors. Ezzati denied wrongdoing and vowed to cooperate with authorities. \"I reiterate my commitment and the commitment of Santiago's Church to the victims,\" Ezzati said in the statement by his office. \"I have the conviction that I never covered up or obstructed justice, and as a citizen will fulfill my duty to contribute all the information that may help clarify the facts.\" Last month police seized documents from the ecclesiastical court of the diocese of Santiago. The child sex abuse crisis has gripped Chile's Catholic Church since 2011, when Chilean priest Fernando Karadima was found guilty by the Vatican of abusing children in the 1970s and 1980s. Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima's victims, said on Twitter that Ezzati has \"little time left as archbishop of Santiago, but his new mission of answering for his cover-up, lies and other crimes ... has just begun.\"",

Seven were killed and nearly 50 wounded. All three of the attackers were shot dead by police.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was fair to ask how the attackers \"slipped through our net.\"Security has become a key issue in the run-up to Thursday's general election. British security officials said none of the men was considered violent, but they acknowledged the difficulty of predicting whether extremists will turn dangerous. The assault was the third attack in three months in which most of the assailants had been on authorities' radar at some point.As the investigation expanded to look at how the men knew one another and whether they were part of a larger conspiracy, Pakistani intelligence authorities swooped Tuesday into the town of Jhelum, where Khurum Butt lived until the time he was 7, when he moved to Britain. His cousin, 18-year-old Bilal Dar, told The Associated Press that Butt's uncle was taken in for questioning. It was unclear if he was detained.\"Our family is hurt by what he did,\" Dar said in the town about two hours east of Pakistan's capital.",

No single party will get a majority; the Socialist party of outgoing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is leading the race; and there will be lawmakers from the far-right Vox party.Beyond that, the result is too close to call.Spanish Prime Minister and Socialist Party candidate Pedro Sanchez, center, smiles for a photo during an election campaign event in Toledo, central Spain, April 26, 2019.

(AP) — As Republicans choose their nominees in dozens of U.S. House primaries across eight states, some establishment-aligned party figures are worried that a surge in conservative firebrands could cost the GOP seats in the general election — and perhaps control of the chamber after November.Primary season can be a precarious time for any political party as factions seek to move it in their direction. But the anxieties are particularly acute within the GOP this year as the party struggles to unify behind a unifying standard-bearer and faces a daunting electoral environment this fall.The Republican candidates running this year are overwhelmingly to the right of their predecessors, an assessment that extends even to traditionally conservative districts. In Missouri’s U.S. Senate contest, the GOP field is filled with candidates who have challenged or opposed mask mandates and are strongly backing former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud.“There is a bit of danger in the extreme positions being taken,” said former Sen. John Danforth, who served three decades ago as the party’s nominee. “There’s a danger that we could lose control of the Senate and lose seats in the House if we go too far, too fast.”If control of the Senate hangs in the balance this year, the GOP’s conservative wing is giving moderates every reason to shy away from open seats this fall.In Texas, Air Force veteran MJ Hegar is the best funded of seven Democrats running for Senate. But she’s being challenged from the right by Republican State Sen. Don Huffines.In Arizona, Democrats have their most crowded primary field in a decade, including several candidates who have backed Medicare for All. That’s prompted criticism from one of the party’s most powerful Senate weapons, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has warned against abandoning the party’s center-left flank.In Alabama, Mo Brooks is so far ahead of the five Republicans running to replace retiring GOP Rep.

Under the 2015 deal, which Trump sees as flawed, Iran reined in its disputed nuclear program under U.N. monitoring and won a removal of international sanctions in return.The ICJ, which is based in The Hague and is also known as the World Court, is the United Nations tribunal for resolving international disputes. Iran's filing asks the ICJ to order the United States to provisionally lift its sanctions ahead of more detailed arguments.\"",

The Inter-Parliamentary Union says its Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians is investigating the cases of 311 MPs from 41 countries - a 13 percent increase over 2013.The data reveal 38 percent of the MPs who faced governmental abuse are from Africa, 25 percent from Asia, 18 percent from the Middle East and North Africa, 14 percent from the Americas and five percent from Europe.IPU human rights program manager Rogier Huizenga said the three worst cases in Africa were Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Eritrea. They represent 21.5 percent of abuse cases on the continent.“DRC - there are a number of serious cases where due process is a concern, where freedom of expression is a concern. Eritrea is the famous case of the G-11, the members of parliament who wrote a critical letter to the authorities, to the president, Afwerki, 2001, and were taken away in September that year and were never seen again. And, then the case in Zambia where there are concerns about the use of the Public Order Act and the limitations that that brings along for the right to freedom of assembly,” said Huizenga.In Asia, the IPU cites 78 MPs from 12 countries who are under threat.It singles out the Maldives as the worst violator.",

Under this deal, the company agreed to invest $1.3 billion in U.S. plants, and created thousands of jobs during the next year.This is a very good development, and GM stock rallied on Monday, and again on Tuesday.GM stock rallied after the UAW announced a deal, but... [+] it is not enough to bring GM back to life. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images) 2016 Getty Images\">Today, General Motors (GM) announced it will idle five plants in the U.S., as part of a major restructuring. While the company will shut down three plants that make large trucks, it is also axing two factories that make cars. In addition, the company will make some production cuts.Investors cheered the news, and GM stock jumped more than 5% in pre-market trading. This is good news for investors, and I think it is great that GM can now plan ahead.It is an especially big deal in terms of financial results, too, as CEO Mary Barra will no longer have to worry about keeping these plants open.She must have been in quite a bind, running a company that builds cars in the U.S., that could not sell them in the U.S. It is not easy running a business when you are forced to manufacture products in the U.S. that nobody wants to buy in the U.S.But now, GM has an answer. It will invest in making cars, with a focus on electric vehicles. In an interesting twist, GM said it would close the two car factories, while launching an electric car brand.With all this good news, why would GM close five plants? Well, first, let's be clear, this is not good news, per se. This is great news for GM stock owners, as it allows GM to make money again in the U.S.But let's be honest. This is not enough to change GM's fate.",

As hundreds more remain camped out in Taiwan’s parliament, the government weighs what to do next. About 2,000 police officers expelled hundreds of protesters from Taiwan’s guarded cabinet offices before dawn on Monday. The government mobilized riot squads and water cannons to oust demonstrators in a five-hour struggle. Protesters want to stop quick approval of the trade deal, calling that approach risky as China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and wants political reunification. Lin Nan-hsin, a 20-year-old protester from a university in central Taiwan, was among those expelled by police. He said there are two camps of protesters, one that advocates peace and the other that prefers a more extreme form of protest as the only way of getting the government’s attention. Lin said that in the end, there was a discussion with the lead protest planners about whether to break into the cabinet complex and finally a go-ahead was given. Taiwan and China signed a service trade pact in June following several other trade and investment agreements reached since 2008.",

The march wound through Georgetown — in stark contrast to the first two weeks, when the protests were largely in Lower Manhattan — before ending up near the Chinese Embassy.Bloomberg and the protesters are clearly divided on how to resolve their issues, including over what to do with the protesters' tents and tarps and how to handle the police efforts to clear Zuccotti Park. The mayor says he supports the protesters' rights to free speech but not to break laws, such as the city's rules on where protesters can sleep and stay.A Bloomberg adviser said Tuesday that the mayor was open to a meeting with the protesters if they came up with a list of three demands. The adviser spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the mayor's thinking.\"What we are trying to do is be a little more respectful and productive,\" the adviser said.Bloomberg, who attended services at a synagogue Tuesday afternoon, was traveling and unavailable for comment, according to his spokesman.On Monday, Bloomberg urged the protesters to hold a \"people's tribunal\" that would determine whether officers in the NYPD had acted inappropriately. Bloomberg said he would also ask the city's Department of Investigation to review police actions.Bloomberg, a political independent who has been an at-times vocal supporter of President Barack Obama, has faced criticism from Occupy Wall Street activists who say the mayor doesn't have much connection to the lives of everyday people.\"",

Trump brought 52 business leaders from New York City to the White House Tuesday to talk about another favorite campaign issue — infrastructure and economic growth. The U.S. economy has so far proven to be a point of pride for a presidency that has otherwise gotten off to a rocky start. Trump inherited a stable economy from former President Barack Obama, an economic recovery that's heading toward its eighth year. But Trump believes he can do more for business. Trump and several of his top aides emphasized plans to cut red tape and jumpstart infrastructure projects at Tuesday's meeting, while also previewing for the CEOs other priorities that include shortening flight times for airplanes, increasing the power grid's efficiency and targeting programs to improve job training. At one point the president had an aide come on stage to hold up a long scroll of the government's approval process for building a highway. The president then pledged to eliminate more than 90 percent of the regulations involved and \"still have safety.'' He provided no details. The administration has committed to directing as much as $1 trillion for infrastructure over the next decade, although it has yet to release policy specifics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently said she expects a plan will be unveiled later this year. But getting a measure through Congress could be difficult given the Republican majority in both chambers and their desire to reduce tax rates as much as possible.",

On Friday, Vietnam's official government newspaper explained that the state-controlled site had been wrong to remove the songs from its online library.“A letter signed by the Vietnam Music Association was submitted to the [Vietnamese] Ministry of Information and Communications on September 22, which stated the association’s concerns that the ministry had not been notified about the decision,” the Vietnamese-language newspaper Nhà Bắc reported Saturday.“It is the association's responsibility to maintain and promote music.

His tunes are widely popular at weddings and other social functions, and his popularity is so high that some of his songs have been described as \"the soundtrack to Vietnamese life.\"The sudden decision to remove his songs from the streaming site, which was made by the state-run Music Association with no explanation or announcement, came days after Vietnamese authorities were widely criticized for pressuring Facebook and Instagram to remove posts criticizing the state's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Saigoneer resumed offering Vu Hung’s songs on Saturday after the newspaper published its report on the controversy.

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

As the Islamic fundamentalist group al-Shabaab launches an unprecedented campaign of violence in Puntland, a self-governing region in northeastern Somalia, regional authorities are losing their patience with the federal government for not doing enough to curb the Islamist group's deadly activities, said a report published by International Crisis Group on Thursday, March 11, 2021.For the first time since 2018, Puntland has experienced a series of deadly attacks and assassinations perpetrated by al-Shabaab that have left dozens dead, including Puntland government officials and prominent members of civil society groups. In the latest attack, on March 10, al-Shabaab militants stormed a popular restaurant in Af Urur on the outskirts of Bosaso, killing several people.Al-Shabaab has killed and maimed hundreds of civilians and government officials in Puntland in recent years, including in an attack on a university in Bosaso in January 2020 in which at least 26 students and staff were killed.According to Crisis Group analysts, al-Shabaab's assault on Puntland reflects the Islamist group's efforts to exploit local dynamics in the conflict-riven country in the hope of achieving its main goal of establishing an Islamic emirate along the lines of its previous self-declared 'Caliphate.'A major factor contributing to the increased volatility in Puntland is the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region. The Tigray conflict, which started on November 4, 2020 and has caused a humanitarian crisis, has led to increased instability in neighbouring regions, including Puntland, where the spillover from conflict in the north has been most felt.The Puntland government has long sought to bolster the capacity of the security forces to confront the Islamist threat posed by al-Shabaab and to end the group's ability to operate with such ease across the region.",

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\"Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \"schizoid policy making.\"Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \"a horrifically chilling signal\" that \"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\"On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies.",

Large scale cyber assaults against Chechnya and Georgia preceded Russia's military actions there.The open nature of the Internet and its use by governments and business make it a rich target for an enemy attacks. Retired U.S. Air Force General Harry Raduege served on the commission that provided President Obama with recommendations on how to best protect the United States from cyber attacks.

The Constitutional Court upheld the election results.Nikol Pashinyan, an opposition activist at the time who was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests, was elected prime minister by parliament on May 8 this year.Kocharyan said the latest charges were politically motivated, but added he was ready to spend time in prison.\"These charges are fiction, fabricated, unjustified and have a political implication,\" he told an independent Armenian Yerkir Media TV.Kocharyan also said the most likely development was his arrest, but he did not intend to run away.\"",

This is an organized attempt to discredit Fudan Marxist students,” the newspaper asserted.In response to these “illegal and criminal activities,” Fudan’s police have launched an investigation into Wang and will also take action against “those students supporting Wang in his illegal activities,” the report claimed. “According to our laws and regulations, we will take an objective and fair stance on all the cases related to student activities in accordance with law,” Fudan University said in a statement cited by the newspaper.China routinely arrests its citizens over the use of illegal speech online, such as using a phone app to post a joke, and often forces those arrested to pay a fine rather than serve time in prison. China also employs internet censorship to block content from Chinese citizens, which often includes information that reflects poorly on the Chinese Communist Party.The People’s Daily did not elaborate on the exact legal violations that Wang allegedly committed. The legal system in China, however, places many restrictions on Communist Party critics and criminalizes speech the party does not approve of.",

She narrowly lost the 2011 presidential election and again ran in 2016, this time losing in a runoff to Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. She also narrowly lost a 2016 bid to become mayor of Lima.She has been a lightning rod for accusations of corruption in the South American nation, though she has not been charged. In October she spent 13 months in pretrial detention as prosecutors investigated accusations she accepted money from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht for her 2011 presidential campaign, but was later released.Her detention came one day after her party, Fuerza Popular, presented Congress with a petition calling for her release.“We must understand that in Peruvian law there is no crime of corruption of relatives. That is to say, Keiko Fujimori cannot be accused or prosecuted for acts committed by her father, who is in prison for other reasons,” the statement said.Her party also petitioned Peru’s National Jury of Elections, which in November 2017 found Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investor, guilty of lying under oath during his 2016 candidacy about his ties to Odebrecht. That led to Kuczynski’s resignation.Keiko Fujimori also is being investigated for allegedly laundering campaign money through Odebrecht, the same accusation that led to Kuczynski’s downfall.The Odebrecht scandal has sent shockwaves throughout Latin America because the Brazilian company has admitted to spreading some $800 million in bribes to officials throughout the region in exchange for lucrative public works contracts.Fujimori’s party is calling for a new, special electoral jury to be created to judge Fujimori and other politicians who lost presidential bids.",

Angola's civil war, which stretched from 1979 to 2002, pitted the government against UNITA rebels.Gaydamak, who lives in Russia, was sentenced in absentia.Another high-level figure, Jean-Christophe Mitterand - the son of former French president Francois Mitterrand - received a suspended sentence and a $550,000 fine. Altogether, 42 people stood trial in the Angolagate affair. Some were acquitted. The main defendants all said they would appeal their sentences.Reactions are beginning to trickle in, following the trial which began a year ago and has made headline news in France.",

Chiusano, said the figures showed the #MeToo movement and increased awareness about sexual harassment had not resulted in an increase in complaints, nor had it resulted in more harassment by employers.\"The fact that we saw an increased number of cases that were actually investigated is a reflection of the growing awareness of how pervasive sexual harassment is in the workforce,\" Chiusano told reporters on a conference call.But he conceded that the EEOC had dropped the number of punishments against employers.The commission handed out more than $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages in fiscal 2018, compared to just over $33 million the previous year.The EEOC is charged with investigating most harassment cases and filing suit against employers where the charges are substantiated.But for the second straight year, it has reported that its \"propensity to sue\" was lower than in the previous fiscal year.EEOC head Janet Dhillon has called on agency lawyers to file more suit for monetary damages in workplace harassment cases.Her goal is to boost the amount of money in penalties the agency is able to hand out to victims of sexual abuse.",

The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight. Poland is currently governed by the conservative Law and Justice party led by Kaczynski's twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is intent on finding and punishing those guilty of his brother's death.",

He said media workers in the country are harassed, threatened, jailed, beaten and even murdered.FILE - Media outlets in Cambodia hold a silent demonstration in Phnom Penh, March 30, 2018.Speaking at the news conference, Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha said he, too, believes that Cambodia's ranking should change.\"I think the ranking should be the 'Not Free' and not 'Partly Free,' because we already know about the facts that the media in Cambodia are not free and independent,\" Sokha said.In response to the change in ranking, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chum Sounry said that Cambodia still deserves a higher ranking because, according to the Reporters Without Borders' ranking, \"there are still some freedoms\" for media to report on sensitive topics. He said the ranking might change because of the changes in media in Cambodia in recent years, with new media outlets, online media and news blogs.Cambodia's ranking for 2017, released last May, did not change from the year before, remaining at \"Not Free.\"Sokha said the government has a responsibility to protect the people's freedoms.\"The government has to guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of expression,\" he said.",

Sharif is in London, along with his children, caring for his wife who is undergoing treatment for cancer.Sharif has denounced the verdict as politically motivated and accused a covert military-judiciary alliance of trying to keep him out of politics and undermining the integrity of his PML-N party to enable alliance favorites to win Pakistan’s upcoming national elections on July 25.",
