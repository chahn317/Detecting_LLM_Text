The new limits in the western Pacific, which make up 60 percent of the worldwide bluefin tuna catch, are expected to protect about one-third of the bluefin tuna population in the region. Last year, fishermen caught nearly 14,000 metric tons of Pacific bluefin tuna, about two-thirds of the worldwide catch.A conservation group said the quotas, which were based on the findings of a scientific survey, will help save the bluefin tuna from extinction.\"This is really a watershed event,\" said David Pimentel, the chairman of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. \"The bluefin tuna is one of the most imperiled species on the planet, and this is an important first step.\"The bluefin tuna is considered one of the most beautiful of fish and is prized for its meat and caviar, which fetches as much as $100 a teaspoon. But there has been growing alarm in recent years about the species, which is nearly extinct in the eastern Pacific Ocean.",

On Thursday he called for the legalization of marijuana at the federal level, expunging past marijuana use convictions and using revenue from sales to repair some of the damage done by the decades-long “war on drugs”.“We have to talk honestly about the War on Drugs that has just been an epic, epic failure, that has unfairly targeted too many African-Americans and Latinos,” Booker said.U.S. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR“Democrats want to see change, we cannot just keep putting a Band-Aid on this broken system. We have a president that is doing everything he can to rip those Band-Aids off,” Klobuchar, 59, said.“I do not think we should decriminalize everything,” she added, saying drug use and abuse should be treated as a health crisis.PETE BUTTIGIEGAsked about former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent move to rescind guidelines that protected legalized marijuana, Buttigieg, 37, said: “We have seen lives being ruined because of petty marijuana possession.”“Marijuana is a drug. I have heard from too many mothers who say, ‘I don’t want this life for my child.’ We should legalize it and regulate it,” Buttigieg added.JULIAN CASTRO“This is not about legalizing marijuana.

It's not as large as some of the larger naval groups China operates in the South China Sea.

And, by the way, Obamacare has been repealed in this bill. …The Republican tax cut is projected to add at least $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that it would increase the deficit by $1.76 trillion over 10 years.)In his speech Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Trump said: \"We will never abolish our heroes, we will never abandon our values and we will never allow a small group of criminals and illegal agents to threaten our safety.\"The phrase \"small group of criminals and illegal agents\" is a reference to MS-13, a brutal street gang that originated in Los Angeles and now has thousands of members across the country.The president has repeatedly exaggerated the role of MS-13 in the recent killing of two Virginia high school students, one of them a Muslim whose family fled to the U.S. from Syria. Federal prosecutors are seeking to death penalty the man charged in their killings, an MS-13 member who was in the country illegally.TRUMP: \"We've saved the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price\" of drugs for other countries.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says Trump is referencing a January article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which Azar said found a 25 percent reduction in the average wholesale price of six of the world's most commonly used drugs. That equates to tens of billions of dollars in potential savings.The article's lead author, Dr. Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool in England, tells The Associated Press it's impossible to know how much of the drug price drop is directly attributable to the administration's actions. It mostly stems from the fact that the prices were inflated to begin with, he said.TRUMP: \"The unemployment rate for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.\"",

It has also put off a plan to start issuing bonds for the first time.The delay is a major setback for Dubai, which has been counting on such deals to fund a series of ambitious construction projects, including the $1 billion expansion of a theme park and an expected increase in the number of people living in the city from 1.5 million to 2.2 million in the next seven years.But Dubai has said it has cash on hand to meet its existing commitments, and it has so far avoided the need to ask its main creditors for a bailout.Still, as it faces a sharp downturn in its economy, Dubai will have to contend with rising labor costs and a growing budget deficit.The city, which was once a playground for millionaires from the U.S. and Europe, has attracted tens of thousands of construction workers from Asia and the Middle East and now has more than 800,000 residents. It has been able to expand its population through the building boom, but is now facing high inflation and a jump in its unemployment rate, which increased to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2009 from 8% at the same time last year.The city’s economy expanded by an average of 7.6% a year during the last decade, but most of the growth came from construction and real-estate activities.The city, which gets most of its revenue from the rent of its vast portfolio of commercial and residential real estate, saw its real-estate prices plunge by as much as 50% in the last year, according to a report by the Dubai Statistics Center.Property developers, who sold many of their units well before the building boom turned to bust, are facing sharp losses.“",

Another 15 people were killed in various Taliban attacks across the country on Friday, including a bombing in the capital, Kabul, that targeted the country’s chief of intelligence.In northern Kunduz province, where the Taliban control many of the remote districts, the insurgents attacked Khan Abad district from several directions on Thursday and fighting is still ongoing, according to Mohammad Yusouf Ayubi, the head of the provincial council. Ayubi said the Taliban have seized several villages but the Afghan security forces are fighting back.The fighting has left 37 civilians dead and around 80 wounded, Ayubi said.The Interior Ministry confirmed the deaths of the police officers on Friday but did not say how many had died in the bus attack. The ministry also confirmed that the Taliban attacked security posts in the districts of Imam Sahib, Sayad and Sherzad.The relentless Taliban attacks underscore the struggles that Afghan security forces have faced since the United States and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. They have continued to fight the Taliban who have seized several districts across the country. The U.S. has meanwhile ramped up attacks, carrying out more airstrikes this year than in the last decade.Afghanistan is also struggling with an Islamic State affiliate that has expanded its footprint in the country, carrying out horrific attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians. The extremists also aim to overthrow the Western-backed government.The Taliban have refused to sign on to a peace deal with the Afghan government, despite repeated overtures from the U.S., saying a permanent cease-fire would only be part of the negotiations.The Taliban have also continued to attack the country’s largest prison on the outskirts of the capital. The insurgents have released hundreds of prisoners in the past two weeks and the battle has left parts of the prison in rubble.",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him.
