The building is in an ethnically diverse, densely populated West London’s North Kensington area. Among those missing on Wednesday were a number of children.Witnesses said they heard screams for help as the fire stormed through the floors, trapping residents who could be seen from windows flashing their cell phone lights in hopes of being rescued. Witnesses said some residents held small children from windows while other people jumped from the lower stories of the building.?Watch video from the scene:Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Why did fire spread so quickly?",

The group’s spokesman, Mohamed Ghandour said the Truth Commission Final Report is biased because it only condemns crimes that were committed during the time of Charles Taylor.Mr. Ghandour said the report only focuses on the actions of the former Liberian leader, Charles Taylor.He said, “The final report of the TRC focuses on the period from 1979 to 2003, excluding the period of 1971 to 1978, in which time a number of people including former warring factions and politicians were responsible for the destabilization of the country. By failing to name the instigators and perpetrators of these atrocities, the Truth Commission has failed to bring the level of transparency needed to create a national reconciliation in the country.”The groups say some people who should be mentioned in the Commission’s report are former President Samuel Doe, the late President William R. Tolbert, and the late Vice President James E. Greene, and the former Special Security Service (SSS).",

They were attacked by a group of seven men and the girl was raped. Her friend was beaten and thrown out of the train. He tried to alert the authorities when the train reached Mathura, but was ignored by the police. The train stopped again at Bharatpur. The police arrested the girl on the charge of ‘having indulged in immoral activities’. At the trial, the judges ruled that the girl was a ‘habitual prostitute’, noting that she came ‘from a bad family and lived in a bad locality’, and that the ‘momentary resistance’ she put up was only because ‘she was used to taking money for sex’. The judges added: “the girl was used to sexual intercourse.”In 1972, a 15-year-old Adivasi girl was raped by four high-caste men while she was on the way to her parent’s house. One of the men had lured her with the promise of marriage and was living with her at her uncle’s house. When he tired of her and refused to marry her, she returned to her parents. At night, he and his friends assaulted her. In court, the judges ruled that the girl was a ‘habitual prostitute’. They noted that she had run away from her family to live with a ‘young man of high caste’; that she had ‘failed to guard her chastity’; that she was a ‘habituated prostitute’, as ‘proved’ by her willingness to live with her boyfriend. They added, ominously: “We think that the evidence on the record conclusively proves that the girl was used to sexual intercourse.”",

It says the new view will greatly help scientists understand solar storms that can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth. VOA's David McAlary reports.The new 3-D images came from twin NASA spacecraft named STEREO, launched last October. They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart. The separation provides a three dimensional view of the sun, just as the offset in our eyes gives us depth perception.Until the advent of this identical pair of observatories, images from Earth telescopes or orbiting solar telescopes were two dimensional. NASA solar scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta says the three dimensional images will help scientists determine where matter and energy flow in the sun's atmosphere much more precisely.\"We have to move away from the traditional sun-Earth line to view the sun from around, from over the poles, from under the poles to really get a deeper understanding of what is inside the sun, what is coming out of its surface, how is it affecting the entire solar system that we live in,\" said Madhulika Guhathakurta.The main STEREO project scientist, Michael Kaiser, says the satellites' depth perception will help improve space weather forecasts.Of particular concern are powerful eruptions of billions of tons of electrically charged gas that smash into Earth's magnetic field at millions of kilometers per hour.",

He observes that the Obama administration -- and now the Trump administration -- has done nothing to effectively respond to the crisis. “While American politicians and the media are too busy fomenting hysteria about Donald Trump’s border wall, Americans remain totally in the dark about a narco-terror crisis that is spilling over into America,” he notes.He warns that “if the U.S. doesn’t wake up to the existential threat Mexico’s narco-terrorists represent, Americans will soon see scenes from Al-Shabaab’s handiwork, played out on their side of the border.”“",

But this vote — which now goes to the full House — could carry more weight because it deals with a high-stakes issue that strikes at the heart of the nation's democracy: The U.S. Census, a count of every resident in the country that's undertaken every ten years.\"By defying this committee's subpoenas, the Trump Administration's cover-up of the real reason for the citizenship question will now be exposed in federal court,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, in a statement. \"The administration claimed that the only reason it wanted to add the citizenship question was to protect voting rights, but that claim has now been exposed as a pretext.\"The vote Wednesday morning, which came after the Justice Department refused a committee demand to release an internal memo related to the citizenship question, is the latest escalation in a long-running fight between Democrats and President Donald Trump's administration over documents. Last week, the Oversight Committee voted along party lines to recommend that the full House hold Barr and Ross in contempt for defying the panel's subpoenas for documents related to the citizenship question.The Trump administration has said the citizenship question is needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. But in a January memo, the bureau's current chief scientist questioned the need for the question, noting that citizenship data was already available from other government sources.",

Another 2.9 million have been out of work for between five and 12 months.

And today, what fighting remains is largely mopping-up pockets of resistance as the U-S leads the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.How was the war won so quickly? And what are the lessons to be learned?Joining me to examine the Iraq war are: military strategist, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters; and military historian Victor Davis Hanson of California State University in Fresno, Califronia.Victor Hanson, let me begin with you. In your view, what was the key factor in the coalition victory in Iraq?MR. HANSON: I think it was the ability to start the ground war almost simultaneously with the air war that gave some tactical surprise, when it was hard to achieve surprise because of the past record in Afghanistan and Kosovo, where we didn't use sizeable numbers of ground troops. It saved the infrastructure. It undermined the Iraqi command-and-control. And it gave some powerful messages that we still could act without our allies, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia. We sort of envisioned the Iraqis -- the Baathists -- as a snake of sorts that was coiled around the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, and rather than just hacking at the coils, we went straight to Baghdad and tried to decapitate it.MR. MORALES: Ralph Peters, let me put that same question to you.MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with everything that has just been said as far as the operational factors go, but I think there is something even beyond that. This really was a civilizational victory.",

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

This system was the main source of support for President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi when he resigned.The Houthis wanted to make the tribal system an alternative to the official government, and this is why they tried to build alliances with the tribes, or at least certain figures within the tribes.In fact, this was one of the Houthis' primary mistakes. Tribes do not belong to individuals, and the tribal system itself does not give them the right to make political decisions.Furthermore, a tribe's authority does not automatically include a ruler, which was a fundamental factor in the Houthis' failure. The tribes want a strong central government and do not accept the Houthis' coup, and this explains why the government has so far retained the majority of tribes' support.There have been reports about battles between pro-government and pro-Houthi tribesmen.",

        "text": "FINISTERE, BRITTANY - After turning a 15th century stone mansion in Brittany into a comfortable bed & breakfast, Scotsman Peter Dinwiddie was left with what he calls a “messy” predicament. What to do with a pair of dilapidated buildings on the edge of his property?Today Dinwiddie, who moved to this bucolic slice of far western France known as the Finistere more than a decade ago, has found the solution. Solar panels glisten from atop a now elegant stone veranda — Dinwiddie’s contribution to a larger energy transition.“We don’t use the electricity as such,” he said ruefully. “We sell it back into the energy grid, and buy it back at half the price from EDF… which is a bit crazy, really.”EDF, or Electricite de France, is France’s national power company, which operates the country’s 58 nuclear power plants, although it also has a renewable energy wing. But to install his solar panels, Dinwiddie turned to Quenea, one of dozens of local companies now mushrooming around the area.As negotiators from 195 nations try to reach a climate deal in Paris, regional and local governments aren’t waiting. Many are forging ahead with their own climate action plans that are sometimes more ambitious than national ones.“If you look at the delivery and implementation of what comes out of Paris, most will take place at the state, regional or city level,” said Libby Ferguson, state and regions director for UK nonprofit The Climate Group. On a local level, she said, “we’re already seeing some really substantial emissions cuts.”",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",

By Tami Abdollah and Anthony McCartney, Associated Press LOS ANGELES (AP) — Don Cornelius, creator of the long-running TV dance show “Soul Train,” shot himself to death Wednesday morning at his home, police said. He was 75. Police said Cornelius died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. The 75-year-old Cornelius’ death stunned the entertainment community, which fondly remembered him and his creation. “Soul Train” began in Chicago as a local program in 1970, the brainchild of Cornelius, a former disc jockey with a passion for the new music and dance scene developing in the black community. He hosted the show, which was broadcast nationally from 1971 to 2007. The catchphrase “love, peace and soul” was the greeting Cornelius used as he opened each show. Cornelius said in 2006 that he remained grateful to the musicians who made “Soul Train” the success it was. “I’m glad I was able to do something with my life that actually meant something,” he said. “And I thank all of the artists that appeared on the show because without them I’m nothing.” Musicians who appeared on the show remembered Cornelius fondly. R&B performer Stephanie Mills told NBC’s “Today” show in a telephone interview Wednesday that Cornelius was very reserved around celebrities. “Don Cornelius was a very, very, very intelligent man — a kind spirit, and I just loved that man,” Mills said. “It’s a sad day for music.",

But smaller and diplomatically isolated Taiwan also claims the disputed Senkaku archipelago, which it calls the Diaoyutai. In Taipei, authorities have shied away from confrontation, while seeking to play a larger role in resolving the conflict. On Tuesday, Taiwanese officials urged Japan and China to back down from a conflict about the Senkaku islets, some 220 kilometers from Taiwan.Taiwan wants Japan to resume talks, after 16 earlier rounds, on fishing rights in waters near the uninhabited islets. Taiwan also asked the other claimants to consider Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s proposal for setting aside their territorial disputes to explore jointly for resources. Foreign Minister Timothy Yang told a news conference in Taipei that he is worried that the conflict will spiral. He says it is easy to escalate a conflict and harder to make peace. But Yang calls Taiwan a peacemaker for the international community and says that, in face of the East China Sea developments, the president has formulated a peace initiative. He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute. When President Ma took office in 2008, he said that despite diplomatic isolation Taiwan would try for more informal participation in international affairs.",

Prosecutors investigating criminal accusations against bishops, clerics and lay workers in the Roman Catholic Church in Chile are also probing claims that Ezzati and others covered up a network of 14 priests who systematically abused minors. Ezzati denied wrongdoing and vowed to cooperate with authorities. \"I reiterate my commitment and the commitment of Santiago's Church to the victims,\" Ezzati said in the statement by his office. \"I have the conviction that I never covered up or obstructed justice, and as a citizen will fulfill my duty to contribute all the information that may help clarify the facts.\" Last month police seized documents from the ecclesiastical court of the diocese of Santiago.

Their analysis revealed the findings that are contrary to the commonly held belief that boys are naturally more gifted than girls in maths, and vice versa with English.The team of experts analysed data from 100 studies dating back to 1942 which in totality contained 308 different data sets. The data sets were then analysed separately, and all together to reach a conclusion. Their findings concluded that boys scored higher in maths, and on a few spatial awareness subtests but, the differences were “minor”. The scores in verbal and language skills were nearly similar. However, there was a noticeable difference in the results of reading comprehension, which was in favour of girls.The findings also revealed that girls performed slightly better than boys on tasks involving writing or fine motor skills, as well as on memory tests.“We found the same questions had been used in many studies for many years. Our analysis of the 1942-1991 data and the 2002-2013 data indicated that these test scores were stable across decades, which suggests large differences in maths performance do not exist. Instead of girls and boys performing differently overall, there was merely a moderate difference in performance in specific skill areas. More than anything else, these results indicate that educational stereotypes based on small differences in performance are a thing of the past,” said David Geary, one of the authors.However, the data does not necessarily indicate that boys and girls are similar on every task.",

No single party will get a majority; the Socialist party of outgoing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is leading the race; and there will be lawmakers from the far-right Vox party.Beyond that, the result is too close to call.Spanish Prime Minister and Socialist Party candidate Pedro Sanchez, center, smiles for a photo during an election campaign event in Toledo, central Spain, April 26, 2019.

Civil society activist Zonke Majodina told reporter Peter Clottey that they condemn the loan and call for its immediate withdrawal.“We as a coalition of civil societies from Swaziland and Southern Africa region are opposed to the approval of the loan by the development bank of southern Africa. And we reject any of this form of conditional support that is given to Swaziland. As you know, this country is under emergency rule; it is under authoritarian rule. And the government is undergoing political problems where there is no respect for political freedom, and the political freedom is not respected at all. People are dying, they are getting exiled and there is a lot of intimidation in the country. So we reject any support from any African country that will enable the government of Swaziland to continue its authoritarian rule that is oppressive and undemocratic in Swaziland,” Majodina said.She said the loan would be used to finance some of Swaziland’s developmental projects such as the sugar cane plantation.“The loan is to fund the construction of sugar cane plantation. The cane will then be sold to the South African Development Community region, and therefore they (South Africa) are going to be the main buyers of this sugar cane that will be produced by the Swazi farmers,” Majodina noted.She said activists condemned the loan from South Africa to Swaziland because it was approved without the consent of the public.“The loan that has been advanced to Swaziland is something that we condemn. And this is something that was not subjected to democratic public participation. There was no consultation that was done before the loan was approved to Swaziland, so we are strongly condemning it. We would like the Southern African Development Bank and the SADC (Southern African Development Community) countries to withdraw the loan from Swaziland.",

The rural vote appears as divided as it is elsewhere.As Egyptians await the results of their first truly open presidential election, fault lines between Islamists and old guard secularists appear to cut across the nation. In the village of Kafr Kandil, south of Cairo, the choice plays well with the largely conservative rural vote: some seek stability in religion, others in past performance. Many of the latter look to veteran diplomat Amr Moussa, who along with former Air Force chief Ahmed Shafik, promises a return to pre-uprising law and order, minus the corruption. Outside the village school, which is serving as the village polling station, Shadia Ewis, a housewife and mother of five, hopes Moussa wins. She thinks he's a \"respectable man\" who \"could control the country.\" Her friend and fellow housewife, Magda Hassan, agrees. She says she wants Moussa to institute reforms, so that it won't be like it was under the old government, when everything was exploited.

He said he first started helping people in the region through a charitable venture.But, he said, the biggest problem in Somaliland was a lack of education for young people.His solution: Somaliland can educate its own students, rather than sending them to boarding schools in the West.“What we want is Somaliland students, and Somaliland-trained teachers to teach Somaliland students in Somaliland, and then, after they finish at Abaarso, to send them all over the world for higher education,” he said.Starr has a vision of what the school can become. He said Abaarso can ultimately train 1,000 educators a year, who can then staff schools all over the country.“If you’re able to teach 1,000 teachers a year and then, with those teachers, you have 1,000 schools, that’s a potential to educate 1 million students a year. That’s not a little bit. That’s a lot, and that can have a real impact in the country,” he said.Starr believes his approach to education will work.“You don’t have to have a Harvard or Princeton degree to be a good teacher,” he said. “There are brilliant students here, who we can train to be excellent teachers here.”Abaarso is starting small.

But NATO officials have been unsatisfied with the pace of Russian troop withdrawals from Georgia and the stationing of Russian surface-to-air missiles in the Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia.NATO also worries that Russia will deploy missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave between Lithuania and Poland, to counter U.S. missile-defense plans. The Russians say that NATO has not done enough to take its concerns into account.The Obama administration is now conducting a review of its plans for missile defense in Europe and Central Asia, and expects to announce a new approach this year.Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO, said he expected the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to “lead to a more constructive relationship with Russia.”Mr. Rasmussen said the alliance hoped that Russia would continue to withdraw troops from a buffer zone around Georgia, and that it would stop building up military forces in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.“I hope the treaty will lead to a new confidence on both sides,” he said in an interview, “and that it will pave the way for a less defensive and more productive relationship between NATO and Russia.”Mr. Rasmussen’s comments were somewhat more hopeful than those of a Russian diplomat who said the treaty’s effect on NATO would be “neutral at best,” and that Russia’s main hope was that the alliance would re-examine its expansion.",

John Richardson said China's military movements from the North Atlantic into the Mediterranean Sea create a \"new dynamic.\"\"Even five years ago, we wouldn't have seen anything like this,” Richardson said.According to Richardson, the Chinese navy is a global one that is both \"ready and capable\" of operating wherever Beijing wants.“They're certainly a pacing competition for us in terms of the naval threat,” he told VOA.However, Chinese operations near the United States' eastern shore are not as threatening as Russian vessels lurking below the ocean’s surface. NATO allies from North America to Europe are increasingly concerned about the uptick of Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic.“We're talking about more (activity) than we've seen in 25 years,” Richardson said.U.S. officials worry that Moscow may try to use its submarines to cut or tap into undersea cables that connect the two continents.Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, speaks to reporters at the Pentagon, July 27, 2018.",

As hundreds more remain camped out in Taiwan’s parliament, the government weighs what to do next. About 2,000 police officers expelled hundreds of protesters from Taiwan’s guarded cabinet offices before dawn on Monday. The government mobilized riot squads and water cannons to oust demonstrators in a five-hour struggle. Protesters want to stop quick approval of the trade deal, calling that approach risky as China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and wants political reunification. Lin Nan-hsin, a 20-year-old protester from a university in central Taiwan, was among those expelled by police. He said there are two camps of protesters, one that advocates peace and the other that prefers a more extreme form of protest as the only way of getting the government’s attention. Lin said that in the end, there was a discussion with the lead protest planners about whether to break into the cabinet complex and finally a go-ahead was given. Taiwan and China signed a service trade pact in June following several other trade and investment agreements reached since 2008.",

Trump brought 52 business leaders from New York City to the White House Tuesday to talk about another favorite campaign issue — infrastructure and economic growth. The U.S. economy has so far proven to be a point of pride for a presidency that has otherwise gotten off to a rocky start. Trump inherited a stable economy from former President Barack Obama, an economic recovery that's heading toward its eighth year. But Trump believes he can do more for business. Trump and several of his top aides emphasized plans to cut red tape and jumpstart infrastructure projects at Tuesday's meeting, while also previewing for the CEOs other priorities that include shortening flight times for airplanes, increasing the power grid's efficiency and targeting programs to improve job training. At one point the president had an aide come on stage to hold up a long scroll of the government's approval process for building a highway. The president then pledged to eliminate more than 90 percent of the regulations involved and \"still have safety.'' He provided no details. The administration has committed to directing as much as $1 trillion for infrastructure over the next decade, although it has yet to release policy specifics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently said she expects a plan will be unveiled later this year. But getting a measure through Congress could be difficult given the Republican majority in both chambers and their desire to reduce tax rates as much as possible.",

His strongest backers want him to be allowed to run for another term next year. Critics say a constitutional change aimed at benefiting a sitting president would be unfair.The Inter-American Development bank is holding a regional meeting in Asuncion starting on Thursday.

Ibrahim al-Ja'afari, head of Iraq's Shi'ite Dawa Party, spoke at a news conference in the southern city of Basra. Shi'ites are expected to play a major role in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. But the recent killings of some Shi'ite politicians have raised concerns among Shi'ites that the Sunni Muslim minority may seek to retain power, even in a free Iraq.Mr. Ja'afari told reporters he is hopeful that a new Iraq, under a new constitution, will be able to deal with the threat posed by the Sunnis. He says he is certain all Iraqis will be able to participate in rebuilding Iraq, and in the political process.The Dawa leader says there was never any serious discussion between the Sunnis and the Shi'ites. But he says that now, in Basra, they are getting together. He says many Sunni Arabs are joining the Iraqi Islamic party, which is affiliated to the Shi'ite Dawa party, and he believes it is only a matter of time before there is an alliance between the two Islamic parties, both Sunni and Shi'ite. Mr. Ja'afari says the first priority is to get rid of Saddam Hussein and his Baathists.The Dawa leader praised U.S. and British efforts to make sure that the elections take place on time. He said there had been concerns in Shi'ite areas, that the elections might be postponed due to the inability of the various parties to reach an accord on how the process should be carried out.Saddam's Iraq is Sunni-dominated, and many Shi'ites fear that the Sunni minority may seek to retain power in a post-Saddam regime, even if the Sunnis do not rule by force.",

Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe issue now looms as the key to unblocking negotiations at Cancún, and the Obama administration said it would now accept a treaty that would allow for the \"review\" of commitments made by the US and other countries.Asked by the Guardian if the US would accept a treaty that contained review provisions but no legally binding commitments, the special envoy, Todd Stern, said: \"Yes. I see no problem with that whatsoever.\"The shift away from binding targets came after the United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, called for more progress by countries to combat climate change. \"The current level of ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is simply insufficient to meet the 2C target,\" he said.\"We are still firmly rooted in the 'business-as-usual' path that the science tells us will lead to dangerous, runaway climate change.\"The US, which is opposed to binding targets for itself and poor countries, has been lobbying hard to build support for its approach.",

This could ultimately mean that some of their more successful programs that deal with educating students and helping them find employment will no longer be funded or could even be terminated.The findings of the report include that NECAC “improperly claimed funding for a project to be administered by a nonprofit agency that did not qualify for federal funding.”A spokesman for NECAC said that the nonprofit agency in question is the Parent As Teachers program. The program was started in Missouri but now has branches nationwide and works to teach parents how to teach their children. In 2015-16, NECAC received more than $600,000 to provide home visits and other services for families through the Parent As Teachers program, according to financial documents. This funding was provided through the Administration for Children and Families, part of the Department of Health and Human Services.NECAC has been working with the federal agency to fix the problem but they have not yet been successful. If NECAC and the Department of Health and Human Services do not come to an agreement, the organization could lose their eligibility to receive federal funding.According to NECAC, this issue is affecting not only their programs at the Wellston location but also programs at the Washington and Hannibal locations. These programs are currently working to ensure they are following all federal regulations. NECAC also stated that other locations could feel the effect of this investigation.One program that could be affected is the A+ program.The A+ program is offered at the Wellston High School and is meant to allow students to attend community college for free.For A+ to be offered, it is required to meet certain criteria, one of which states that the community college must offer an associate’s degree or career certificate.",

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

The combination of these three threads, some say, makes for a perfect recipe.“Each of them is almost like a mini conference by itself that attracts all the greatest innovators and leaders from that space / You get this great serendipity, the interaction and the mixing of all those different kinds of creative people and that’s really the special sauce of South by Southwest,” said Joshua Baer, executive director of the Capital Factory.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\"Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \"schizoid policy making.\"Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \"a horrifically chilling signal\" that \"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\"On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies.",

Many experts are worrying about what might come next and are urging the government to take preventive measures to defend America's vital infrastructure.Experts say the August 6 attacks that briefly shut down the Twitter and Facebook social networking websites were aimed at silencing a Georgian blogger who is critical of Russia's military incursion into his country last year. Large scale cyber assaults against Chechnya and Georgia preceded Russia's military actions there.The open nature of the Internet and its use by governments and business make it a rich target for an enemy attacks. Retired U.S. Air Force General Harry Raduege served on the commission that provided President Obama with recommendations on how to best protect the United States from cyber attacks. He spoke to the World Affairs Council in Houston earlier this month about the dangers and costs of cyber assaults.\"It is estimated that $1 trillion worth of data was stolen, globally, in the year 2008,\" he said.General Raduege later spoke about how countries and private businesses can protect themselves.\"What you really have to do is manage the risk. We are vulnerable to these attacks.

The Constitutional Court upheld the election results.Nikol Pashinyan, an opposition activist at the time who was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests, was elected prime minister by parliament on May 8 this year.Kocharyan said the latest charges were politically motivated, but added he was ready to spend time in prison.\"These charges are fiction, fabricated, unjustified and have a political implication,\" he told an independent Armenian Yerkir Media TV.Kocharyan also said the most likely development was his arrest, but he did not intend to run away.\"",

Staged the day before Putin's May 7 presidential inauguration, that rally ended in violence with 20 policemen injured and 436 protesters detained.

Later, a police source told Interfax that police confiscated nearly $1,900,000 from Sobchak's apartment.

        "text": "WARSAW - A Polish court on Tuesday convicted and handed a suspended prison term to a former deputy head of government security over the 2010 plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others. The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight. Poland is currently governed by the conservative Law and Justice party led by Kaczynski's twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is intent on finding and punishing those guilty of his brother's death.",

A 52-year-old nurse on Thursday became the first medical professional in Spain to die of COVID-19.In Italy, where the number of virus-related deaths surpassed those in China, 2,900 health care providers have been infected, or 10% of the country's total. Italian broadcasters regularly feature exhausted doctors and nurses begging people to stay home and expressing a sense of abandonment over inadequate protective gear.The Dutch health minister collapsed from exhaustion in the midst of a parliamentary session on Wednesday.\"We're clapping tonight out of respect and to say thank you to all the health care workers in the Netherlands who are protecting us against this horrible coronavirus,\" King Willem-Alexander said while observing the ritual Tuesday night with his family at Palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague.The word spread mostly through the WhatsApp messaging service.",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- The slums and shanties of New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata may offer fertile ground for the coronavirus that has struck in neighboring China and threatens the subcontinent’s economy.About two-thirds of the country’s urban population live in slums and 66.6% of India’s 21 million migrant workers are employed in the informal sector, making them vulnerable to job losses. China accounted for about one-third of India’s $483 billion in merchandise exports in the financial year through March 2019, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry, and Indian companies are bracing for a hit to revenue.While India accounts for just 2% of the world’s gross domestic product, that masks its economic influence. In addition to its status as the fastest-growing major economy, its burgeoning population of 1.4 billion, a third of whom are under the age of 35, make it a potential powerhouse. It was on track to become the world’s fifth-largest economy, surpassing the U.K. and France.“If you look at the Indian economy, there’s the formal economy and the unorganized economy,” said K.J. Joseph, economics professor at New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University. “A bulk of exports from the unorganized sector go to China and a bulk of imports are from China. If that kind of trade gets disrupted, it’s going to have a big impact on the Indian economy.”The coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has killed more than 130 people, spreading to at least 17 countries. It’s unclear what will be the economic impact of the outbreak, but there are some parallels with the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic of 2003.SARS was estimated to have cost China’s economy about $40 billion, and the Asian Development Bank cut its 2003 growth forecasts for developing Asia because of it.",

Experts estimate that in a 10-year period the loss of Indonesian wildlife to illegal trade might be as high as 60 percent. The wildlife trade includes many endangered species and is mostly driven by demands of foreign countries.In the last two decades there has been an increasing demand for Indonesian wildlife from the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and China. Many of these exotic animals are for pets. Others are sold for their skin and fur.Djoko Poerwanto of Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry, says there are 600 different species of animals being traded in Indonesia. And, about 200 of them are included in the international trade of endangered species.\"They have big ears. They are so lovely. It's easy to capture, because they are not fast. It has a high price also,\" he said.The mammals come from all over the country, from Borneo, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Java. There are many different species of monkey, the slow loris, lizards, tortoises, and snakes. But, there are also other, less appealing animals as well.\"In the market they sell rats. That's true. And it is not only a domesticated rat. They also sell the bigger rat, also,\" said Mr. Poerwanto.Experts estimate that more than one million animals and birds were caught from Indonesia's jungles and sold to traders and smugglers in the 1990s. If this number is accurate, they say the nation stands to lose as many as 60 percent of its unique animal species by the year 2010.The Ministry of Forestry's director of biodiversity, Niek Ploeg, says many of the animals will die within a year after being caught and sold.\"They are very sensitive to change in the environment,\" he explained. \"For example a slow loris is very difficult to keep in captivity, because you have to give them very specialized food.",

The U.N. refugee agency says thousands of civilians in north Yemen are fleeing to neighboring provinces in a desperate search for safety, shelter and assistance.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo followed up talks with Dimitrov by expressing strong support for the deal, signed this summer, in which Macedonia agreed to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. Greece and Macedonia have been feuding over who gets to use the name since Macedonia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Many Greeks say allowing the neighboring country to use the name insults Greek history and implies a claim on the Greek territory also known as Macedonia, a key province in Alexander the Great's ancient empire. As a result, Greece has blocked Macedonian efforts to join the EU and NATO. Despite recognition by 137 countries, Macedonia is officially known at the United Nations as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). \"It's a great day for Macedonian diplomacy,\" Dimitrov said of his meeting with Pompeo, which he described as \"very encouraging.\"\"We are now focused on our homework — we need to win a referendum to get our people to stand behind the name agreement that we have reached with our friends in Greece that unlocks the doors for the future,\" he said. \"And here the support and friendship of our American partners is extremely important.

He told journalists in the seaside resort that he stood by the government's claim that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction had been a serious threat.His comments came on the eve of a special parliamentary inquiry into why British and U.S. intelligence services failed to find evidence of prohibited Iraqi weapons programs.During the parliamentary session later on Friday, members of Mr. Blair's ruling Labor Party suggested the prime minister had led Britain to war based on false claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction.British troops are searching the entire country of Iraq without finding anything of the kind.Mr. Blair's Labor Party was split in two over Britain's decision to join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
