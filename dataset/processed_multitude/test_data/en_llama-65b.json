The US wants them to stop fighting, but how can that be achieved if they’re not treated with respect,” he added.He said Pakistan would continue to help the US in its Afghan peace process but Washington “must change its line of action in Afghanistan.”He said Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan were good and both countries need to work together towards a shared objective.On a question, the foreign minister said Afghanistan is a land-locked country and its future economic prosperity depends on Pakistan. “It would be in Afghanistan’s interest to have good relations with Pakistan,” he said.When asked about the fate of the proposed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS), Qureshi said Pakistan would continue its bilateral relations with the US.On Saturday, Qureshi said the two-day talks between representatives of the US and the Taliban were paused after the Afghan government pulled out of the meetings.He said the Afghan government pulled out of the second round of US-Taliban talks in Doha because of an “agenda disagreement”.",

It will move further in a north/northeast direction and weaken gradually,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement, as it lowered its cyclone warning.There were no reports of casualties in the state, the agency said, but three people died in the path of the storm elsewhere.A 12-year-old girl died in the eastern state of Odisha after a tree collapsed on a hut in which she was sheltering, NDTV reported.Another man was killed in Andhra Pradesh when a tree fell on him and a fisherman was killed after being crushed by the mast of his boat after refusing to take shelter on land, according to IANS news service.Some 2.14 million people were evacuated from coastal districts in Odisha as the state suffered a blackout, with supply lines snapped by three major ‘extremely severe cyclonic’ storms expected over the next three days.Airports at Kolkata and Bhubaneswar were shut until Saturday as the storm, dubbed “extremely severe” by the IMD, pounded the region.The Bangladeshi government ordered the evacuation of more than one million people along the coast. Hundreds of thousands of them took refuge in shelters as the storm approached the low-lying nation, officials told AFP.“",

At the ceremony, 15-year-old Rosa Fukun will be one of the flag carriers for the first Olympic team from East Timor.While many young East Timorese are looking to independence with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, Rosa Fukun has no doubts.\"I am very proud and happy to be selected,\" she said, \"This will be a great moment. This will be a good moment in East Timor's history.\"Miss Fukun was one of many teenage girls, chosen through a nationwide talent search. She was born in East Timor, fled with her family during the Indonesian occupation and now goes to school in Portugal, where her mother lives.East Timor's team will include three other women and four men, including two marathoners. They will all be under the age of 21, and they are in the last stages of training and fund-raising.Olimpio Lopez is the East Timorese chef de mission. \"These are the first athletes we can call athletes and not just sports people. They are athletes now because they're in good shape. I think it's very important that people from outside get the message that the future belongs to the young, and there are other people who deserve to live and be happy.\"While the athletes will proudly march in the opening ceremonies of the games, they will only participate in the marathon event, so they have chosen to march in the second half of the parade of nations. There are many small states participating in the games, most of which have far smaller populations than East Timor.Still, East Timor's athletes have a strong advantage. The island of Bali, just 100 kilometers away, boasts one of the world's largest marathons every June, so East Timorese runners have had lots of practice.",

His father, Girma, claims that he was tortured to death by police. Girma told FBC in an interview that he visited his son on 6 June at the Police Station where he was being held. He claimed that his son had been tortured, with visible injuries on his body and that he was denied medical treatment. Girma said that his son had been killed following his arrest and that police claims of Behailu dying of typhoid were untrue. The father is adamant that his son had died due to beatings by police.Based on eyewitness accounts, Behailu was stopped and questioned by members of the Addis Abeba Police Commission’s 32nd unit. As police were suspicious of Behailu, they took him into custody along with his mother’s iPhone 8 and his own Galaxy S9. When the phone was returned, his family members claim that there was an SD card missing from the handset. The police arrested Behailu and accused him of robbery, based on the assumption that he was trying to sell the phone for money.",

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be? I am certain it will be John's.''Said House Speaker Paul Ryan, ``His legacy is so long that John McCain is a hero to us all.''",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",
