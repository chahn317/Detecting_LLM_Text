The situation is particularly dire in Zimbabwe, where the number of people facing food shortages has doubled since last year. Malawi and Zambia are also among the hardest-hit countries, with millions of people facing severe hunger.The UN has warned that the situation is likely to worsen in the coming months, as the region enters the peak of the lean season. The organization is appealing for $700 million in aid to help address the crisis, but so far, only a fraction of the funds have been pledged.The situation in Southern Africa is a stark reminder of the urgent need for long-term solutions to address the root causes of hunger and poverty. Climate change, conflict, and economic inequality are all contributing to the crisis, and will continue to do so unless action is taken to address these underlying issues.In the short term, however, it is vital that aid is delivered to those in need, and that governments and international organizations work together to provide emergency assistance and support the most vulnerable communities.",

The country's anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), will conduct inspections on 78 state-owned enterprises in the country, according to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.The inspections aim to improve governance, as well as uncovering any corruption or misconduct. The CCDI has said that it will focus on areas such as bidding and procurement, financial management, and the use of public funds. In addition, the watchdog will examine the backgrounds of senior management, to ensure that they have not been involved in any illegal or unethical activities.State-owned enterprises have been the target of China's anti-corruption campaign for several years, as they are seen as particularly vulnerable to misconduct and graft. The CCDI has already investigated several high-profile cases, including the former head of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the former chairman of China's biggest nuclear power producer.Analysts suggest that the latest round of inspections reflects President Xi Jinping's continued commitment to tackling corruption, as well as his desire to maintain control over state-owned enterprises.",

The raids took place at two of Fernandez's properties in Buenos Aires and Patagonia, where authorities seized documents and electronic devices.Fernandez, who currently serves as a senator, has denied any wrongdoing and accused the current government of targeting her for political reasons. She has been implicated in several corruption cases, including a high-profile scandal involving public works contracts awarded to a construction company linked to her and her late husband.The raids come amid a turbulent period for Argentina, which is grappling with a deep economic crisis and high inflation. President Alberto Fernandez, who is no relation to the former president, has promised to tackle corruption and restore economic stability, but critics argue that his government has not done enough to address these issues.The investigation into Fernandez's alleged corruption has been ongoing for several years and has involved numerous high-profile figures in Argentine politics and business. The raids mark a significant development in the case and are likely to lead to further scrutiny of Fernandez and her associates.The former president remains a divisive figure in Argentina, with some seeing her as a champion of social justice and others viewing her as a symbol of corruption and political arrogance. The outcome of the investigation is likely to have significant implications for the country's political landscape and its future direction.",

Musharraf stated that Pakistan would cooperate fully with the Afghan government in its efforts to combat terrorism. The President’s remarks were well-received in Afghanistan, where authorities have long expressed concerns about the lack of action by Pakistan to help control the activity of Taliban militants and other extremist groups operating from across the border. Musharraf also emphasized the need for cooperation from all countries in the region, including Iran, India, and China, in order to effectively combat terrorism. The speech came amidst rising tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly after the Taliban’s recent seizure of the Afghan city of Kunduz. Both countries have accused the other of providing support to the Taliban and other militant groups. This is not the first time that Musharraf has pledged to cooperate with Afghanistan on counterterrorism efforts, but there is hope that this time he will follow through on his promises. The international community, including the United States, has expressed its support for increased cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fight against terrorism.",

The talks come in the wake of recent gains against the extremist group, which has suffered territorial losses in both countries.US Secretary of State John Kerry met with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss the proposed expansion of the two countries' partnership. According to State Department spokesman John Kirby, the two officials had \"a very good conversation\" about strengthening cooperation in \"a number of ways\".Turkey has long been a crucial partner in the fight against IS, providing a base for US military operations and conducting its own airstrikes against the group. However, the country's involvement has been complicated by its ongoing conflict with Kurdish militants in Syria, who are also fighting against IS.The new push for cooperation between the US and Turkey comes at a time when the international community is intensifying its efforts to combat the extremist group. Last week, France hosted a summit of 20 countries in Paris to discuss strategies for fighting IS, while Russia has stepped up its military campaign in Syria.The US and Turkey are expected to continue their talks in the coming days, with a view to announcing new measures in the fight against IS in the near future. Despite the progress made against the group in recent months, it remains a formidable threat in both Syria and Iraq, and analysts say that a sustained effort will be required to defeat it completely.",

Rarely has the sickbed been so lively.McCain is promoting a new book, delivering a counterpunch of ideals contrary to President Donald Trump's running of the White House. McCain's long-distance rejection of CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's history with torture goaded former Vice President Dick Cheney into a fresh debate over waterboarding and other now-banned interrogation techniques. On Friday, friends rallied to defend McCain against a White House official's cruel joke that his positions don't matter because ``he's dying anyway.''If this is Washington's long goodbye to a sometimes favorite son, it's also a reemergence of old resentments and political fault lines that continue to split the nation.Perhaps no one should have expected anything less from the 81-year-old senator, who can be crotchety and cantankerous but is also seen by many, both in and out of politics, as an American hero, flaws and all.Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday as McCain ``fights for his life, he deserves better -- so much better.''``Our children learn from our example,'' Biden said. ``The lingering question is: Whose example will it be? I am certain it will be John's.''Said House Speaker Paul Ryan, ``His legacy is so long that John McCain is a hero to us all.''",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",
