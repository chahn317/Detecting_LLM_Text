The building is in an ethnically diverse, densely populated West London’s North Kensington area. Among those missing on Wednesday were a number of children.Witnesses said they heard screams for help as the fire stormed through the floors, trapping residents who could be seen from windows flashing their cell phone lights in hopes of being rescued. Witnesses said some residents held small children from windows while other people jumped from the lower stories of the building.?Watch video from the scene:Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Why did fire spread so quickly?",

Kim Hyun-hee - once sentenced to death for blowing up an airliner - says she may have information about the Japanese woman's fate.Former North Korean spy Kim Hyun-hee wiped tears from her eyes, Wednesday, as she spoke to the brother and son of a Japanese woman who disappeared decades ago.Kim told the relatives not to give up hope and that they will see the woman again. Kim Hyun-hee has not appeared in such a high-profile way since 1991 - when she spoke to the South Korean public about an act of terrorism she was convicted of committing, four years earlier. Kim says she placed a bomb on a Korean Airlines flight that exploded in midair, killing all 115 people on board. For that crime, she was sentenced to die, then given a South Korean presidential pardon.To fulfill her mission, Kim posed with another North Korean agent as a married Japanese couple. She says was able to speak and act as a Japanese person because she was taught for two years by Yaeko Taguchi - the woman whose family says she was abducted to North Korea in 1978.Wednesday's emotional meeting between Kim and two of Taguchi's male family members took place in Busan.",

The individual, a man, appeared in the video alongside Maxime Hauchard, a French convert to Islam who was identified in the video as one of the executioners of Syrian soldiers. The new identification raises concern about the number of French citizens who have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq. French authorities estimate that approximately 1,000 French nationals are currently fighting with ISIS, making France the European country with the highest number of citizens among ISIS' ranks. The French government has been taking steps to combat the threat of radicalization, including implementing a new law that allows for the confiscation of passports of those suspected of planning to join jihadis abroad. Despite these measures, many experts believe that the number of French citizens fighting with ISIS will continue to rise.",

While the debate on whether Britain should stay in or leave the EU continues, many are wondering what will happen after the referendum.If Britain votes to remain in the EU, the status quo is expected to be maintained. The UK will continue to be part of the EU, and the negotiations that have been taking place will continue. If the UK chooses to leave, however, the impact is expected to be significant.One of the first things that will happen after a vote to leave is that the UK will need to negotiate a new relationship with the EU. The process is expected to be long and complicated, as the UK tries to maintain access to the EU's single market while negotiating new trade deals with other countries.The UK will also need to negotiate new immigration policies, as the EU free movement will no longer apply. This could potentially impact on the UK's economy, as many businesses rely on immigration to fill critical skills gaps.If the UK votes to leave the EU, it will also need to negotiate new deals with other countries that are currently covered by the EU's trade agreements. This could be a lengthy process, as many countries may not be willing to negotiate with the UK until it has finalised its relationship with the EU.In addition to the above, a vote to leave the EU could also have an impact on the unity of the United Kingdom itself. Scotland and Northern Ireland have both indicated that they may hold their own referendums on independence if the UK votes to leave the EU.Ultimately, the impact of the Brexit vote is hard to predict. What is certain is that it will bring significant change to the UK and its relationship with Europe and the rest of the world.",

The elimination of measles is defined as the interruption of endemic transmission of the virus in a specific geographic area, which requires at least three years of zero reported cases following a mass vaccination campaign. Bhutan and Maldives have been able to achieve this milestone through their strong commitment to immunization programs and sustained efforts to reach remote and marginalized populations.\"Eliminating measles is a testament to the remarkable efforts and dedication of health workers and communities in these countries to protect themselves and their children from a disease that is entirely preventable with a safe and effective vaccine,\" said Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director of WHO South-East Asia.The achievement of Bhutan and Maldives is a significant step towards the goal of the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012-2020, which aims to eliminate measles in five WHO regions by 2020. Currently, four of the six WHO regions have validated the elimination of measles, including the Americas, Europe, the Western Pacific, and now, South-East Asia.However, measles remains a significant public health concern globally, with an estimated 140,000 deaths reported in 2018, mostly in children under the age of five.

The attack, which took place on Tuesday, is the latest in a series of violent incidents in Iraq, raising concerns about the security situation in the country.According to eyewitnesses, the militants arrived at the police station on foot and opened fire on the guards before detonating a bomb. The explosion was so powerful that it could be heard across the city. The attackers then went inside the building and engaged in a fierce gun battle with the police, causing widespread panic and chaos.The Iraqi security forces were quick to respond to the attack and managed to kill three of the militants, while the rest fled the scene. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment, and the area around the police station was cordoned off.The attack in Tikrit comes as the IS has been increasingly active in the country, particularly in the northern and western regions. The group, which was declared defeated by the Iraqi government in 2017, has been able to regroup and launch new attacks in recent months, taking advantage of the political instability and the ongoing conflict between Iraq and the United States.The Iraqi government has vowed to take strong measures to tackle the IS threat and improve security in the country. However, the latest attack shows that the group remains a serious threat to the stability and safety of Iraq.The United Nations has condemned the attack and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.

The government must take urgent action to address the root causes of violence and extremism, while also strengthening its security forces to prevent further attacks.

We do not want war,\" Falahatpisheh said.His comments come just days after the US announced that it would deploy additional troops and military hardware to the region in response to what it says are credible threats from Iran.Tensions between the two countries have been rising since the US pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last year and imposed tough sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Iran has responded by threatening to resume uranium enrichment and taking other measures to step up its nuclear program.The situation has been further complicated by recent attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, which the US has blamed on Iran.Despite the escalating tensions, both sides have expressed a willingness to engage in talks, with Iranian officials stating that they are open to negotiations with the US if certain conditions are met.However, the Trump administration has taken a hard-line stance on Iran and has shown no signs of backing down from its demands.With both sides refusing to back down, the risk of military conflict in the region remains high, but for now, at least one senior Iranian official is emphasizing that war is not what Iran wants.",

It says the new view will greatly help scientists understand solar storms that can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth. VOA's David McAlary reports.The new 3-D images came from twin NASA spacecraft named STEREO, launched last October. They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart. The separation provides a three dimensional view of the sun, just as the offset in our eyes gives us depth perception.Until the advent of this identical pair of observatories, images from Earth telescopes or orbiting solar telescopes were two dimensional. NASA solar scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta says the three dimensional images will help scientists determine where matter and energy flow in the sun's atmosphere much more precisely.\"We have to move away from the traditional sun-Earth line to view the sun from around, from over the poles, from under the poles to really get a deeper understanding of what is inside the sun, what is coming out of its surface, how is it affecting the entire solar system that we live in,\" said Madhulika Guhathakurta.The main STEREO project scientist, Michael Kaiser, says the satellites' depth perception will help improve space weather forecasts.Of particular concern are powerful eruptions of billions of tons of electrically charged gas that smash into Earth's magnetic field at millions of kilometers per hour.",

According to the EEOC's data, there has been a 12 percent increase in the number of harassment charges filed with the agency during the fiscal year 2018 compared to the previous year.The EEOC, which is responsible for enforcing federal laws against workplace discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, received a total of 7,609 harassment charges in the fiscal year 2018, up from 6,754 charges in the previous year. The agency also noted that it recovered nearly $70 million for victims of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation through mediation, settlements, and litigations in the same fiscal year.The #MeToo movement, which gained momentum in late 2017 and early 2018, encouraged women and men to speak up about their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the workplace. The movement led to a wave of public allegations against powerful figures in the entertainment, media, politics, and other industries.The EEOC's report suggests that the movement has also emboldened many workers to report incidents of harassment in their own workplaces. However, some experts caution that the increase in complaints may not necessarily mean an increase in the actual prevalence of harassment, but rather a greater willingness of victims to report it.The EEOC's acting chair, Victoria A. Lipnic, said in a statement that the agency is committed to preventing and addressing harassment in the workplace, and encourages employers to take proactive steps to prevent it. \"Harassment is not just a workplace issue, it's a community issue, and we are all responsible for maintaining a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination,\" she said.",

We sort of envisioned the Iraqis -- the Baathists -- as a snake of sorts that was coiled around the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, and rather than just hacking at the coils, we went straight to Baghdad and tried to decapitate it.MR. MORALES: Ralph Peters, let me put that same question to you.MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with everything that has just been said as far as the operational factors go, but I think there is something even beyond that. This really was a civilizational victory.",

The treatment, known as mAb114, was developed by the US National Institutes of Health and has been shown to be effective in laboratory tests on animals. It will be used alongside other experimental treatments in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, which has so far claimed 41 lives.The latest outbreak of Ebola was declared on 1 August, with 57 cases reported to date. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids and can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, internal and external bleeding. The current outbreak is the second in the Congo this year, and the tenth in the country's history. The World Health Organization has declared it a \"public health emergency of international concern\".The deployment of the experimental treatment has sparked controversy, with some arguing that its effectiveness has not been sufficiently proven in human trials. However, the Congolese government and international health organizations have defended its use, citing the urgent need to contain the outbreak. \"We are now in a new phase of the Ebola outbreak that is spreading faster and posing a higher risk to public health,\" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. \"We need to act now.\"The WHO has also urged the Congolese government to increase efforts to engage with affected communities and promote safe burial practices, as well as to improve surveillance and contact tracing. The organization has said that it will work with local health workers and international partners to provide the necessary resources to combat the outbreak.The deployment of the experimental treatment comes amid growing concern about the spread of Ebola in the region. The virus has also been reported in neighboring Uganda, where two deaths have been confirmed. The WHO has warned that the risk of the virus spreading to other countries in the region is \"very high\". As such, efforts to contain the outbreak are likely to intensify in the coming weeks and months.",

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Critics argue that the proposed spending cap will hurt social programs and education, and that it will disproportionately affect low-income families. There are also concerns that the government will cut back on environmental and health regulations in order to save money. Despite the opposition, Temer is pushing ahead with his plan. He says that the government cannot continue to spend more than it earns, and that sacrifices must be made in order to restore fiscal balance. \"We cannot continue like this,\" he said in a recent speech. \"We need to change our ways and reduce the size of the state.\" Brazil has been in a deep economic crisis for the past few years, with high unemployment and rising inflation.

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

This comes in response to calls from some members of Congress to investigate the investigation, particularly in light of the recent release of the Mueller report. The statement suggests that any attempt by Congress to reopen the investigation would be a waste of time and resources, and that the administration is fully committed to moving forward. It also raises concerns about the potential political motivations behind such a move, suggesting that some in Congress may be seeking to score political points rather than genuinely seeking justice.Despite the White House's clear stance on the matter, it remains to be seen how Congress will respond. Some lawmakers have already expressed their support for further investigation, while others have argued that it is time to move on and focus on other important issues facing the country.Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the Mueller probe will continue to be a contentious issue in Washington and beyond. With so much at stake, it is more important than ever for the American public to stay informed and engaged on this critical matter.",

But smaller and diplomatically isolated Taiwan also claims the disputed Senkaku archipelago, which it calls the Diaoyutai. In Taipei, authorities have shied away from confrontation, while seeking to play a larger role in resolving the conflict. On Tuesday, Taiwanese officials urged Japan and China to back down from a conflict about the Senkaku islets, some 220 kilometers from Taiwan.Taiwan wants Japan to resume talks, after 16 earlier rounds, on fishing rights in waters near the uninhabited islets. Taiwan also asked the other claimants to consider Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s proposal for setting aside their territorial disputes to explore jointly for resources. Foreign Minister Timothy Yang told a news conference in Taipei that he is worried that the conflict will spiral. He says it is easy to escalate a conflict and harder to make peace. But Yang calls Taiwan a peacemaker for the international community and says that, in face of the East China Sea developments, the president has formulated a peace initiative. He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute. When President Ma took office in 2008, he said that despite diplomatic isolation Taiwan would try for more informal participation in international affairs.",

The money will be used to pay for improvements made by the farmers on the land they lost. The government is hoping that this move will help to improve relations between the country and the West.The land reform program in Zimbabwe began in 2000 and was aimed at redistributing land from white farmers to black farmers. The move was popular among many black Zimbabweans who had been forced to work as laborers on white-owned farms for generations. However, it was also controversial, as many white farmers were violently forced off their land, often losing everything they owned.The compensation plan has been welcomed by some, but others have criticized it as a betrayal of the land reform program's goals. Many black Zimbabweans still do not have access to land, and some have accused the government of giving in to pressure from Western nations who have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in response to the land reform program.President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said that the compensation plan is part of his efforts to improve relations with the West and revive the country's struggling economy. The move has been praised by some Western countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, who have called on Zimbabwe to compensate the farmers for years.The government has not yet announced how the compensation will be distributed, or how many farmers will be eligible to receive it.

The surge in defense spending is driven by a tense border dispute with neighboring China and a rise in terrorist activities. India's military spending reached $72.9 billion in 2021, up from $71.1 billion in 2020, according to a report by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). This makes India the third-largest defense spender in the world, after the US and China. The SIPRI report also shows that India is the second-largest arms importer in the world, behind Saudi Arabia. Its arms imports rose by 54% between 2011-2015 and 2016-2020. The main suppliers of arms to India are Russia, France, and Israel. India's focus on military modernization has also led to the creation of a $130 billion fund for defense procurement, which aims to boost indigenous production of arms and reduce reliance on imports. However, critics have raised concerns over the increase in defense spending, arguing that it could divert funds away from important social and economic programs. Despite these concerns, India's Defense Minister, Rajnath Singh, has defended the spending, stating that it is necessary to ensure the country's security in a volatile region. As tensions continue to rise in the Indo-Pacific region, it remains to be seen how India's increased military spending will impact the country's relations with its neighbors and the global community.",

The limited roads and airports are in a poor state, making it difficult to transport large amounts of food aid. Additionally, the threat of piracy off the coast of Somalia has made it even more challenging to deliver aid by sea.The logistics of food aid transport have also been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has affected air, sea, and land transport worldwide, making it harder to get aid to those who need it. In Somalia, the pandemic has led to the closure of borders and increased restrictions on movement, which have further complicated aid transport.Despite these challenges, aid organizations and the United Nations continue to work tirelessly to ensure that food aid reaches those who need it. They have been using various methods to transport aid, including trucks, ships, and planes. They have also been working closely with local communities and governments to ensure that aid is distributed fairly and efficiently.In conclusion, food aid transport to Somalia remains a complicated task due to logistical challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, piracy, and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, aid organizations and the United Nations are committed to delivering aid to those who need it and are working tirelessly to overcome these challenges.",

The decision comes after Israeli authorities reportedly refused to meet the demands of the Hamas delegation. Hamas is seeking the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for Israeli soldiers who were captured during clashes in Gaza. The group claims that Israel is holding more than 5,000 Palestinians, including women and children, as political prisoners.The suspension of talks is a setback for both sides, as a prisoner exchange agreement has been seen as a potential confidence-building measure. It could have also helped to ease tensions in the long-standing conflict between the two sides.Hamas and Israel have fought several wars and engaged in numerous clashes over the years. The two sides do not have direct diplomatic relations, and the talks were being facilitated by Egypt and the United Nations.The suspension of talks highlights the difficulty of finding a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also underscores the continued disagreement between Hamas and Israel over the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.",

The report also claimed that China has been engaging in covert biological weapons research for years.However, China has rejected these claims, stating that it \"always strictly abides by the Biological Weapons Convention and other international treaties on arms control\". The Chinese Foreign Ministry also added that China has actively participated in global efforts to prevent the use of biological weapons and has called for greater cooperation in this field.The accusations come amid increased tensions between the US and China over trade, human rights, and the coronavirus pandemic. Some analysts have suggested that the report may be an attempt by the US to deflect criticism away from its own handling of the pandemic.Despite China's denial of the allegations, the report is likely to further strain already fraught relations between the two nations.",

The rural vote appears as divided as it is elsewhere.As Egyptians await the results of their first truly open presidential election, fault lines between Islamists and old guard secularists appear to cut across the nation. In the village of Kafr Kandil, south of Cairo, the choice plays well with the largely conservative rural vote: some seek stability in religion, others in past performance. Many of the latter look to veteran diplomat Amr Moussa, who along with former Air Force chief Ahmed Shafik, promises a return to pre-uprising law and order, minus the corruption. Outside the village school, which is serving as the village polling station, Shadia Ewis, a housewife and mother of five, hopes Moussa wins. She thinks he's a \"respectable man\" who \"could control the country.\" Her friend and fellow housewife, Magda Hassan, agrees. She says she wants Moussa to institute reforms, so that it won't be like it was under the old government, when everything was exploited. Getting a fair shake from the government is a key concern of Islamist candidates' supporters, too. Farmer Ali Hassan Abdel Baki believes the best man for the job is the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi.

However, after years of negotiations, the group signed a peace agreement with the Colombian government in 2016. As part of the agreement, FARC surrendered their weapons and began the process of reintegrating into society.Now, in an unexpected turn of events, former FARC rebels have been enlisted to fight deforestation in Colombia. The country has been struggling with deforestation for years, with an estimated 200,000 hectares of forest lost annually. The government hopes that by employing former FARC members, they can combat the issue while also providing employment opportunities for those previously involved in the conflict.The project, which is being funded by the United Nations Development Programme, has already employed over 2,000 former FARC members across the country. These individuals are now working as park rangers, forest guards, and wildlife guides, amongst other roles.The move has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the initiative for providing former FARC rebels with a path to reintegration while also helping to protect the environment. Others, however, are skeptical, pointing out that there may be security concerns with employing former rebels in this capacity.Despite the concerns, the project is still in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how effective it will be in combating deforestation. However, it is clear that the Colombian government is taking the issue seriously and is willing to try new and unconventional approaches to address the problem.",

The report highlighted a disturbing pattern of excessive use of force by the Turkish police, resulting in the deaths of numerous individuals, including children and peaceful protesters.According to HRW, Turkish authorities have consistently failed to investigate and prosecute those responsible for such killings, leading to a culture of impunity. This has left victims and their families without justice, and has allowed police officers to continue to use deadly force with little accountability.The report also criticized the lack of transparency in investigations into such cases. Many families are not provided with basic information about the circumstances surrounding the death of their loved ones, and are denied access to the reports and evidence collected during investigations.HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, Hugh Williamson, called on Turkish authorities to take immediate action to end impunity for state killings. \"The Turkish government needs to demonstrate that it is committed to protecting the right to life and ensuring justice for victims of police abuses,\" he said in a statement.The report comes at a time when Turkey is facing increasing criticism from human rights organizations and the international community for its crackdown on dissent. The government has been accused of targeting journalists, activists, and opposition politicians, and of suppressing free speech and assembly.HRW's report on state killings in Turkey is a stark reminder of the need for authorities to respect human rights and the rule of law.

The Independent candidates, who had the backing of King Abdullah, ran under the banner of the National Current Party and competed against other parties, including the Islamic Action Front, which is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.The results have been hailed as a victory for King Abdullah, who had been pushing for the participation of Independent candidates.

Additionally, ISIS has already spread its message and ideology to various parts of the world, including North Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe.

The country has been torn apart by decades of conflict, and the government is struggling to establish a stable and effective administration.The situation in Puntland is just one example of the wider challenges facing Somalia. It is hoped that the crisis group's report will help to raise awareness of these issues and encourage the government to take action to address them.",

The storm hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi on March 14, 2019, and has been described as one of the worst weather-related disasters in the region's history.The cyclone produced torrential rains, strong winds, and massive floods that swept away homes, bridges, and roads. The death toll continues to rise, with reports suggesting that more than 700 people have been killed across the affected countries. Thousands more have been injured or displaced.The impact of the cyclone has been particularly devastating in Mozambique, where entire communities have been submerged under water. Aid workers are struggling to reach those who are trapped or stranded, with many areas remaining inaccessible due to the severe flooding.Experts have warned that the aftermath of the cyclone could be just as deadly as the storm itself, as the risk of disease outbreaks, food shortages, and further flooding increases. Relief efforts are underway, but they are being hampered by the scale of the disaster and the lack of resources and infrastructure in the affected areas.The southern African cyclone is a reminder of the devastating effects of extreme weather events, which are becoming increasingly common due to climate change. It is also a testament to the resilience and courage of the affected communities, who are working together to overcome the challenges and rebuild their lives.",

The report claims that only one out of the eight contracts analyzed was publicly available, while the rest were either confidential or secret. Uganda discovered commercially viable oil reserves in the country in 2006, and since then has been negotiating with international oil companies to extract and export the oil. The government has promised that oil revenues will be used to fund social and economic development programs in the country, but the lack of transparency in the contracts raises concerns about possible corruption and mismanagement. Transparency International has called on the Ugandan government to disclose the contracts and make them publicly available, in order to ensure accountability and prevent corruption. The organization also urged international oil companies to improve their transparency and accountability practices when negotiating with governments. The Ugandan government has not yet responded to the report, but has previously defended the confidentiality of the oil contracts, citing the need to protect commercial interests. However, critics argue that this secrecy creates opportunities for corruption and undermines the government's commitment to transparency and accountability. As Uganda prepares for the exploitation of its oil reserves, it is crucial that transparency and accountability are prioritized to ensure that the benefits of oil revenues are shared fairly and used for the country's development.",

At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

The theft was conducted through the SWIFT global payments network and involved the transfer of funds from Bangladesh Bank's account held with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Bangladesh Bank has accused RCBC of \"intentionally, deliberately, and maliciously\" allowing the stolen money to be transferred to fake accounts, despite warnings from the central bank. The funds were then withdrawn and laundered through casinos in the Philippines. RCBC has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that it acted in good faith throughout the entire process. The bank has also pointed out that it was not a party to the transaction involving the transfer of funds from the Federal Reserve Bank to the Philippines. This is not the first legal action taken by Bangladesh Bank in relation to the cyberheist. In 2019, the bank reached a $20-million settlement with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over its failure to detect and prevent the fraudulent transfer. The case highlights the growing threat of cybercrime and the challenges faced by financial institutions in preventing such attacks. It also underscores the importance of cooperation and coordination between banks and regulators in combating cyber threats.",

The suspects, identified as 40-year-old Emraan Ali and 29-year-old Samir Ahmed, were both captured in Syria earlier this year by Kurdish forces. They were subsequently turned over to US authorities, who had been seeking their extradition for several months.According to the US Justice Department, Ali and Ahmed are both US citizens who had traveled to Syria to join ISIS in 2014. While there, they allegedly received training in weapons and explosives, and were involved in the group's operations in both Syria and Iraq. The Justice Department has described them as \"extremely dangerous individuals\" who pose a significant threat to national security.After their capture, both men were held in detention by Kurdish forces for several months before being handed over to US officials. They were flown back to the US on Wednesday and are now being held in custody pending trial. They are expected to face multiple charges related to their alleged involvement with ISIS, including conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and possession of firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence.The extradition of Ali and Ahmed is seen as a significant victory for US law enforcement officials, who have been working for years to track down individuals who have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. The group's territorial hold in Syria has been largely eliminated in recent years, but there are still concerns about the potential threat posed by individuals who have returned to their home countries after fighting for the group.In a statement, US Attorney William Barr praised the work of the Kurdish forces who helped capture Ali and Ahmed, and vowed that the US would continue to pursue individuals who have traveled abroad to support terrorist organizations. \"We will not forget the victims of ISIS, and we will not rest until those responsible for their suffering are brought to justice,\" he said.",

The country has been investing heavily in developing tourist infrastructure and services, and promoting its tourism industry in key markets around the world.One example is the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to boost economic cooperation and connectivity between China and other countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Tourism plays a key role in this initiative, with China promoting its tourism attractions and encouraging its citizens to travel to participating countries.China is also using tourism to strengthen ties with countries that have signed up to its strategic partnerships, such as the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area and China-Africa Cooperation Forum. By investing in tourism infrastructure in these regions and promoting Chinese culture and hospitality, China hopes to improve its relations with these countries and increase economic cooperation.However, China's use of tourism as a foreign policy tool has been criticized by some, who argue that it is being used to exert political influence and pressure on other countries. For instance, China has been accused of using tourism to limit the number of visitors to Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.Overall, China's use of tourism as a means to boost its economy and foreign policy is likely to continue in the coming years.

The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight. Poland is currently governed by the conservative Law and Justice party led by Kaczynski's twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is intent on finding and punishing those guilty of his brother's death.",

The disease mainly affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.Despite being curable with multidrug therapy, leprosy remains a public health challenge in many countries, particularly in India, Brazil, and Indonesia. In 2019, there were 212,000 new cases of leprosy globally, with nearly half of them occurring in India.The good news is that early diagnosis and treatment can prevent disability from leprosy. The key is to recognize the signs and symptoms and seek medical help as soon as possible.The early symptoms of leprosy can be mild and may take years to develop. They can include:- Patches of skin that are lighter or redder than normal- Loss of feeling or tingling in the hands and feet- Muscle weakness- Numbness or pain in the affected areas- Eye problems that may lead to blindnessIf left untreated, leprosy can progress and cause irreversible nerve damage, leading to clawed hands and feet, facial deformities, and blindness. However, with early diagnosis and treatment, the progression of the disease can be halted, and the affected person can be cured without any residual disability.Multidrug therapy is the standard treatment for leprosy and involves taking a combination of antibiotics for six to 12 months, depending on the type of leprosy. The treatment is provided free of charge by the World Health Organization and its partners.In addition to early diagnosis and treatment, preventing the spread of leprosy is also crucial. Leprosy is transmitted through respiratory droplets, but it is not highly contagious. People who have been in close and prolonged contact with an untreated person with leprosy are at higher risk of infection. Therefore, it is essential to identify and treat new cases early to break the chain of transmission.In conclusion, leprosy can cause severe disability if left untreated, but early diagnosis and treatment can prevent it.",

Greece and Macedonia have been feuding over who gets to use the name since Macedonia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.

So far, 86 cases have been confirmed, with six deaths reported.The outbreak was first detected in the town of Katiola, which has been the hardest hit by the disease. Meningitis is a serious disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, and can be fatal if not treated quickly.Health officials have urged residents in the affected areas to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms such as fever, headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. The disease is spread through close contact with an infected person, and can also be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces.The government has launched a vaccination campaign in the affected areas, and is working to raise awareness about the disease and how to prevent its spread. Health workers have also been dispatched to the region to help treat those who are sick.Meningitis outbreaks are not uncommon in Africa, particularly during the dry season when dust and other particles can exacerbate the spread of the disease. However, swift action by the government and health officials can help prevent further cases and save lives.",

In June, gunmen attacked the headquarters of the G5 Sahel Force in Sevare, killing six people. In July, a French military patrol was ambushed in the northern city of Gao; four civilians were killed in a shootout.FILE - A still image taken from a video shot on June 29, 2018, shows damaged buildings inside the headquarters of the G5 Sahel military task force in Sevare, Mali.\"Extremists are a threat to [Malian] democracy, a threat to our way of life,\" said Niankoro Yeah Samake, former Malian ambassador to India and one of the presidential candidates during the last elections.\"Today in Mali, there are people and students who cannot go to school because of insecurity,\" said Aissatou Traore, a student living in Bamako.\"",

She has made several visits to Panzi Hospital in the DRC's South Kivu Province, where many rape victims are brought. From Toronto, Canada, she spoke to VOA English to Africa Service reporter Joe De Capua about her impressions when she paid her first visit to the hospital.\"Because of V-day?I've spent the last 10 years traveling to probably 60 and I've spent a lot of time in what I call the rape mines of the world. You know, in Bosnia, in Afghanistan and Haiti and Kosovo. But I have to tell you nothing quite prepared me for the level of violence and atrocities that I heard and witnessed in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" she says.She says that the war has been allowed to continue with impunity, describing the government as non-functional and UN peacekeepers as ineffective. \"Because it's gone on for so long, it's become ordinary. It's become something that's now a part of everyday life. As an activist said there, rape has become a country sport,\" she says.Ensler says estimates put the number of women raped in the eastern DRC in the last 10 years at up to 400,000. \"But the kind of violence that's going on ? the gang rapings, the militias that are released knowing that they have AIDS and released on communities knowing they have STDs?",

Sharif is in London, along with his children, caring for his wife who is undergoing treatment for cancer.Sharif has denounced the verdict as politically motivated and accused a covert military-judiciary alliance of trying to keep him out of politics and undermining the integrity of his PML-N party to enable alliance favorites to win Pakistan’s upcoming national elections on July 25.",
