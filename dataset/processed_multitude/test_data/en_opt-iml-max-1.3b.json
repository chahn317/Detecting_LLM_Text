The building is in an ethnically diverse, densely populated West London’s North Kensington area. Among those missing on Wednesday were a number of children.Witnesses said they heard screams for help as the fire stormed through the floors, trapping residents who could be seen from windows flashing their cell phone lights in hopes of being rescued. Witnesses said some residents held small children from windows while other people jumped from the lower stories of the building.?Watch video from the scene:Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video to view it offline.Why did fire spread so quickly?",

Kim Hyun-hee - once sentenced to death for blowing up an airliner - says she may have information about the Japanese woman's fate.Former North Korean spy Kim Hyun-hee wiped tears from her eyes, Wednesday, as she spoke to the brother and son of a Japanese woman who disappeared decades ago.Kim told the relatives not to give up hope and that they will see the woman again. Kim Hyun-hee has not appeared in such a high-profile way since 1991 - when she spoke to the South Korean public about an act of terrorism she was convicted of committing, four years earlier. Kim says she placed a bomb on a Korean Airlines flight that exploded in midair, killing all 115 people on board. For that crime, she was sentenced to die, then given a South Korean presidential pardon.To fulfill her mission, Kim posed with another North Korean agent as a married Japanese couple. She says was able to speak and act as a Japanese person because she was taught for two years by Yaeko Taguchi - the woman whose family says she was abducted to North Korea in 1978.Wednesday's emotional meeting between Kim and two of Taguchi's male family members took place in Busan.",

This question may become more and more relevant to the country during the remainder of the Trump presidency. The decision would be driven by a desire on the part of Democrats to maintain control over the legislative branch, while making sure they retain control over the administration.Trump’s current Deputy Attorney General Matt Whitaker has already been critical of Mueller’s investigation and has accused Rosenstein of leaking the contents of the special counsel’s team memos. There has also been speculation that Mueller’s findings could damage Trump’s political prospects for reelection, and if he decides that he is not going to get to the bottom of the truth from the Special Counsel, he will fire Rosenstein and start his own investigation, similar to the way George W. Bush used to operate when he felt he was not getting the results he wanted.If the Department of Justice (DOJ) decides that it is a question of whether Rosenstein should step away from overseeing the Mueller investigation, or more importantly, whether the President should allow a third person into the investigation, this could lead to a major political showdown.In fact, if there were a third person in charge, it would be far more difficult for the White House to claim that it has no connection to the investigation, which is currently going on inside the White House. Even if the President decides that he has the right person in charge and has no intention of giving up his investigation, he would have to answer to the question of if he should pardon or pardon Mueller’s team of investigators. This would open up a new series of scandals if the President decides to pardon or pardon them before he is forced to fire the investigator or if Mueller’s team of investigators or prosecutors, as a whole, have become so enraged and frustrated that they retaliate by finding a way to go on national TV and claim that the President or the administration has interfered with the investigation.The question of whether or not Rosenstein should step away from oversight of the Mueller investigation is not just a political issue. This issue, and the possible ramifications, should be of utmost concern to the entire country.One of the most interesting questions facing the country, not just Democrats, is if President Trump had a collusion or obstruction of justice. We know that President Trump has denied allegations of having collusion, but it may not be as simple as that.",

The Kurdish delegation may be able to force the Iraqi government into a coalition with them, since parliamentarians are required to be Kurdish themselves.According to the sources, in order to break their political impasse, the Iraqi government has given the Kurds a promise that the Kurdish leadership will be free to set up a security force and police force.The leaders of the Kurdish political parties have been invited to come to Baghdad and discuss with the prime minister and other senior government officials the terms of the compromise reached between the Kurds and the Iraqi government, which is said to include the creation of an autonomous police force that is responsible for security along the northern and southern Iraq borders.A Kurdish political source told Kurdistan24.net that he expected a deal to be reached soon, as the next elections are set to take place in April 2016. However, the Kurdish leaders are expected to hold back until they are sure of the Iraqi government’s support to take them on.If Baghdad’s backing for the Kurds comes into question, it is believed that the Iraqi military could launch a military operation against them, similar to how the U.S. carried out a crackdown against the Kurdistan Regional Government in 2003.",

It focuses on the case of Andre Jones, charged in 2018 with the 2017 murders of 27-year-old Andre Bledsoe and 23-year-old David \"DJ\" Bell. The killings were the first murders of the year in Detroit.Jones, 25, allegedly lured the two victims with lies about a drug deal before killing them. But prosecutors allege he orchestrated the killings out of greed and hatred for police and those who worked to curb violent crime.The killings took place during a decade of record homicides in Detroit that have been largely blamed on police. More officers have been killed and more residents shot in Detroit since the turn of the century.Jones' defense team has argued that prosecutors ignored many factors before charging Jones.According to witnesses during the trial, Jones and others plotted to murder the two men for months. After the deaths, police questioned Bledsoe's mother. Police were later involved in an altercation with Jones and several other people, but the shooting was unrelated to the killings.The shooting has become a flashpoint in the Black Lives Matter movement. Some prosecutors say the killing could have been prevented with other police techniques to keep people in check. A prosecutor has said the killing was pre-planned.The trial was initially scheduled to be delayed after a juror was exposed to the coronavirus. However, the judge presiding over the trial allowed the jury to continue on Tuesday, the last day of testimony.A prosecutor said the juror and 12 other people were safe from contracting the virus. The 12 were sequestered in a hotel. They will be sent to a facility on Thursday to begin serving as jurors, and possibly begin the trial on Friday.The defense is expected to call another lawyer to replace the first trial-opening juror. The defense will likely ask for a mistrial or to dismiss the case outright.The prosecution will appeal the judge's ruling on the voir dire — which means the jury selection process — and ask to see the juror who originally was sequestered, Judge Steven Rhodes.© 2020 The Associated Press.

It says the new view will greatly help scientists understand solar storms that can disrupt communications and power systems on Earth. VOA's David McAlary reports.The new 3-D images came from twin NASA spacecraft named STEREO, launched last October. They are orbiting the sun, one slightly ahead of Earth and the other slightly behind, gradually separating from each other until they are 500,000 kilometers apart. The separation provides a three dimensional view of the sun, just as the offset in our eyes gives us depth perception.Until the advent of this identical pair of observatories, images from Earth telescopes or orbiting solar telescopes were two dimensional. NASA solar scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta says the three dimensional images will help scientists determine where matter and energy flow in the sun's atmosphere much more precisely.\"We have to move away from the traditional sun-Earth line to view the sun from around, from over the poles, from under the poles to really get a deeper understanding of what is inside the sun, what is coming out of its surface, how is it affecting the entire solar system that we live in,\" said Madhulika Guhathakurta.The main STEREO project scientist, Michael Kaiser, says the satellites' depth perception will help improve space weather forecasts.Of particular concern are powerful eruptions of billions of tons of electrically charged gas that smash into Earth's magnetic field at millions of kilometers per hour.",

The move was long overdue: in 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex unions were legal in Indonesia. But after the decision, several Indonesian organizations began an advocacy campaign, pushing for a repeal of the law.In recent months, the number of states that have allowed same-sex marriages have more than doubled. The most notable are: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Iowa, Oklahoma, and most recently Florida, which recently became the 11th U.S. state to permit same-sex unions.And now, in Indonesia, the Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriages are legal nationwide, but with many hurdles. As you'll see, it's not a simple change as many believe it will be. The Indonesian LGBTQ community is divided, with many hoping that the ruling will mean equal marriage rights for them and others in Indonesia. And it's all a matter of how that's applied:Homosexuality: \"All people need to feel accepted by society.\"Transgender: \"Transgender people are people of the opposite sex who need to change their gender for the right reasons.\"Discrimination: \"Discrimination against anyone based on sexual orientation is legal.\"Homosexuality: \"Homosexuality is a natural desire or sexual attraction; a human being cannot choose to be a homosexual.\"Transgender: \"Transgender people are people who change their gender for the right reasons.\"Discrimination: \"Discrimination against anyone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is legal and is punishable by law.\"Heterosexuality: \"Heterosexuality is a romantic attraction between a man and a woman, as well as a romantic attraction between a man and a woman.\"Discrimination: \"Discrimination against anyone based on sexual orientation is allowed and is punishable by law.\"The Indonesian LGBTQ community, as well as activists working to expand rights for the community, is divided. And some hope that the ruling will mean equal rights, others believe the Indonesian government and courts have become so stacked in support of the Christian and conservative majority they are ignoring the rights of the country's LGBTQ community.

The agency reported that a number of baby food products sold in the U.S. contained non-recyclable single-use plastic straws and balls.The agency noted it would \"provide additional guidance on how best to minimize the use of non-recyclable plastic straws and balls from infant formula products, particularly with respect to those found to contain non-recyclable straws and balls.\"It is, though, far from certain that there are no such products on the market and that the EPA will be able to do much about them. As the agency's director of outreach tells it, there aren't a whole lot of plastic options available in terms of recyclability.The Consumerist reported earlier this year that a few manufacturers had been sending back some of the plastic they'd produced for baby food in an attempt to \"get around\" the EPA's restrictions, which ban the use of single-use plastic bottles for food products.Some of the baby food manufacturers have also been offering reusable bottles, which they say can be made from recycled bottles. The issue is that these products are sold at a variety of price points, with some costing around $100.On top of that, some of the best-selling baby food brands are not even using 100% recycled bottles for infant formula, The Consumerist noted earlier this year.Even in some cases, which may be easily recyclable, there's still not necessarily a market for all of these products, consumer advocates say.Many of the companies that have stopped making plastic straws and balls for baby food say the straws and balls have helped improve their bottom line, as people use them on an ever-increasing basis to drink from their beverages.The Consumerist's sources say that the straws and balls, and other products that may not be 100% recycled, are still available to buy at supermarkets, but the bulk of the supply is in the hands of other companies, not baby food manufacturers.\"We can't buy all the plastic,\" one major baby food manufacturer said this summer. \"It's a business decision.

Be an advocate for a few values at a time and find ways to appeal to all Americans.4. Don't be seen as being against any group or ideology. Instead, you should portray the GOP as the party for all Americans. This allows you to appeal to those who don't fit the party label.5. Make an argument for Republican principles. You can't please everyone, but by framing a specific case for Republican ideals, you can appeal to moderates as well as conservative-leaning Republicans.6. Focus on the issues that matter most to people, and you can make those a litmus test for presidential candidates.7. Make your case in terms you believe the other side isn't willing to listen to. These include: why you don't want health care reform, why your kids are on the welfare system, what your income taxes are like, how the Middle East is threatening our national security, and so on.8.

VOA National correspondent Jim Malone has more from Washington. Republican candidate John McCain spoke in Wisconsin and said the U.S. central bank should stop bailing out failed financial institutions, and should return to the main job of managing the money supply and guarding against inflation.McCain said that, if elected president, he would set up a Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust, MFI for short, which he says would help homeowners avoid foreclosure.\"The MFI will restore investor and market confidence, build sound financial institutions, assist troubled institutions and protect our financial system, while minimizing taxpayer exposure,\" he said.McCain also ramped up the attacks on his Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama. McCain said Obama's ties to the failed mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, including campaign contributions, make him part of the problem.\"We've heard a lot of words from Senator Obama over the course of this campaign,\" he said. \"But maybe, just this once, he could spare us the lectures, and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems.\"",

The new prime minister, Tansuada Demir, has promised a new election will take place in July.But many believe this will come at a cost, given Turkey is not yet ready to meet the political and economic standards set for entry into the bloc.“",

And today, what fighting remains is largely mopping-up pockets of resistance as the U-S leads the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.How was the war won so quickly? And what are the lessons to be learned?Joining me to examine the Iraq war are: military strategist, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters; and military historian Victor Davis Hanson of California State University in Fresno, Califronia.Victor Hanson, let me begin with you. In your view, what was the key factor in the coalition victory in Iraq?MR. HANSON: I think it was the ability to start the ground war almost simultaneously with the air war that gave some tactical surprise, when it was hard to achieve surprise because of the past record in Afghanistan and Kosovo, where we didn't use sizeable numbers of ground troops. It saved the infrastructure. It undermined the Iraqi command-and-control. And it gave some powerful messages that we still could act without our allies, such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia. We sort of envisioned the Iraqis -- the Baathists -- as a snake of sorts that was coiled around the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, and rather than just hacking at the coils, we went straight to Baghdad and tried to decapitate it.MR. MORALES: Ralph Peters, let me put that same question to you.MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with everything that has just been said as far as the operational factors go, but I think there is something even beyond that. This really was a civilizational victory.",

The police alleged that a group of young Kenyans had tried to attack another station when they were on their way there.The alleged attack on the station, which happened in December 2007, triggered clashes between Kenyan police and the group of youths.When the youths attacked the station, they were surrounded and shot by the police, the group claimed.At least 1,000 people died in the incidents, including 300 who were killed in an attack the same year in neighbouring Somalia, according to a report by the BBC.But the Kenya Police Command has denied that it has used excessive force to quell unrest and claimed that the police have only acted professionally.Rights group Amnesty International has accused police of using excessive force and using live bullets against civilians.

That has made political parties sit up and take notice in a country where a slim margin can make the difference between victory and defeat. To mark women’s empowerment, the Election Commission set up hundreds of “pink booths” in the country during the five-week general election that wraps up Sunday. In the capital, New Delhi, several polling stations were festooned with balloons and staffed with women and volunteers who handed out roses and sweets setting a festive atmosphere. There may well be reason to celebrate: the hope is that this general election will virtually close the voter gap between men and women, which five decades ago stood at 15 per cent but narrowed down to one and a half per cent five years ago. “The elimination of the gender gap in turnout would be a monumental achievement, especially in a conservative, patriarchal society like India’s,” says Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment. “In 2019, nearly all parties are touting their pro-women credentials if for no other reason than they cannot afford to alienate a growing segment of the electorate.”",

Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. The power plant stopped operating in April after Hamas could no longer afford to buy heavily taxed fuel from Abbas' West Bank-based government, leaving Gazans with just four hours of electricity a day. Abbas also asked Israel to reduce the electricity it sends to Gaza, which amounts to about a third of the territory's needs. This electricity, paid for by the Abbas government, has been reduced by one-fourth since Monday, worsening the crunch. The power shortage has cast a pall over the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often end their dawn-to-dusk fasting with lavish family meals. With their homes in the dark and refrigerators not functioning, families have had to scale back the celebrations. Yousef al-Kayali, a Hamas finance official, said 11 trucks delivered the fuel on Wednesday. He said a second shipment of an additional 1 million liters was expected by Thursday. The fuel will not solve Gaza's electricity woes, however. Israel is now providing just 88 megawatts of power each day, down from 120 megawatts earlier this week.",

This could help strengthen the Iraqi opposition, which has been trying to form a government since last year.The vote's first phase, in which Iraqis cast their ballots for their preferred candidates, had a little more than 8 million voters eligible, according to the Interior Ministry.There has been a lot of talk about turnout but turnout actually has been lower than last year.Turnout in the 2014 elections was about 45%. This is actually higher than the turnout in Iraq's first election in 2004, which was also held under security of the Islamic State group.This time around, a quarter of voters voted in the first round, and the other five in the remaining rounds.Polling stations were opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Tuesday to avoid any confusion caused by people opening their ballots on Tuesday evening.Al-Abadi's office released results from polling stations across the country on Tuesday, with a small number of people having cast ballots since voting began last week.The Interior Ministry said that turnout for the first round was 23,818. It said 8,611 of the ballots had come from the Shiite part of the country, while 2,507 were from the Sunni part of the country.The official turnout figures from the vote were yet to be released.Last year, Abadi secured a majority vote of more than 50% and won an absolute majority in parliament.",

What to do with a pair of dilapidated buildings on the edge of his property?Today Dinwiddie, who moved to this bucolic slice of far western France known as the Finistere more than a decade ago, has found the solution. Solar panels glisten from atop a now elegant stone veranda — Dinwiddie’s contribution to a larger energy transition.“We don’t use the electricity as such,” he said ruefully. “We sell it back into the energy grid, and buy it back at half the price from EDF… which is a bit crazy, really.”EDF, or Electricite de France, is France’s national power company, which operates the country’s 58 nuclear power plants, although it also has a renewable energy wing. But to install his solar panels, Dinwiddie turned to Quenea, one of dozens of local companies now mushrooming around the area.As negotiators from 195 nations try to reach a climate deal in Paris, regional and local governments aren’t waiting. Many are forging ahead with their own climate action plans that are sometimes more ambitious than national ones.“If you look at the delivery and implementation of what comes out of Paris, most will take place at the state, regional or city level,” said Libby Ferguson, state and regions director for UK nonprofit The Climate Group. On a local level, she said, “we’re already seeing some really substantial emissions cuts.”",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him. Former Indian ambassador to the United States Lalit Mansingh said the U.S. was bound to follow suit. “It would be quite embarrassing for the Americans not to recognize a democratically elected leader.",

More than 1,100 prisoners were held longer than 10 months, including many for many years.In one case, the prisoner was held for over seven years, and died in March 2003, when Iraqi authorities recognized that the prisoner was a U.S. citizen. At the same time, the prisoner's mother was denied his right to claim compensation under a law created to provide compensation to U.S. prisoners held in Germany after World War I.Mr. Leahy added that while there has been some improvement in Iraq in terms of prisoner treatment and freedom of the press, there are still too many problems. He said that since the first detainee has been released, there have been at least five more detained American prisoners.Mr. Leahy said that he believes there is still time to make fundamental improvements to the treatment of POWs and prisoners of war.

The government said the activists and their supporters were planning a failed coup.On Monday, Ledezma's lawyer, Julio Borges, said that his client was still being held by authorities in Caracas, though that led to the suspension of the extradition proceedings the State Department had long said it was pursuing. Ledezma, along with some opposition figures and other alleged coup plotters, were the subject of a May 8 report in the Miami Herald based on a leaked government document that described Ledezma's arrest and called for his release, an arrest that the U.S. embassy in Caracas said at the time was \"unacceptable.\"Pompeo's announcement Tuesday that Ledezma would be sent back to the U.S. for a possible trial was a welcome step. But for Pompeo to meet with Arreaza on the same day was especially unusual. It's not clear what prompted Arreaza to meet with the secretary of state, as some reports suggested.\"",

In Taipei, authorities have shied away from confrontation, while seeking to play a larger role in resolving the conflict. On Tuesday, Taiwanese officials urged Japan and China to back down from a conflict about the Senkaku islets, some 220 kilometers from Taiwan.Taiwan wants Japan to resume talks, after 16 earlier rounds, on fishing rights in waters near the uninhabited islets. Taiwan also asked the other claimants to consider Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s proposal for setting aside their territorial disputes to explore jointly for resources. Foreign Minister Timothy Yang told a news conference in Taipei that he is worried that the conflict will spiral. He says it is easy to escalate a conflict and harder to make peace. But Yang calls Taiwan a peacemaker for the international community and says that, in face of the East China Sea developments, the president has formulated a peace initiative. He adds that Ma is urging all sides to restrain themselves, set aside disputes, solve conflicts in a peaceful way and develop East China Sea resources together. The minister’s words reflect what analysts call the government’s underlying motives for seeking a broader role in the dispute. When President Ma took office in 2008, he said that despite diplomatic isolation Taiwan would try for more informal participation in international affairs.",

Ezzati denied wrongdoing and vowed to cooperate with authorities. \"I reiterate my commitment and the commitment of Santiago's Church to the victims,\" Ezzati said in the statement by his office. \"I have the conviction that I never covered up or obstructed justice, and as a citizen will fulfill my duty to contribute all the information that may help clarify the facts.\" Last month police seized documents from the ecclesiastical court of the diocese of Santiago. The child sex abuse crisis has gripped Chile's Catholic Church since 2011, when Chilean priest Fernando Karadima was found guilty by the Vatican of abusing children in the 1970s and 1980s. Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima's victims, said on Twitter that Ezzati has \"little time left as archbishop of Santiago, but his new mission of answering for his cover-up, lies and other crimes ... has just begun.\"",

        "text": "LONDON - Details emerged Tuesday of the three London Bridge attackers: a Pakistan-born failed customer service clerk with links to one of Europe's most prolific hate preachers, a Moroccan pastry chef whose partner said he once went swimming rather than see his daughter and an Italian national who told authorities he \"wanted to be a terrorist.\"At least two of the men were known to British intelligence and law enforcement officials, raising questions about whether anything could have been done to stop the attack, which began Saturday when the men drove a rented van into a crowd and then leaped out to stab people who crossed their paths. Seven were killed and nearly 50 wounded. All three of the attackers were shot dead by police.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was fair to ask how the attackers \"slipped through our net.\"Security has become a key issue in the run-up to Thursday's general election. British security officials said none of the men was considered violent, but they acknowledged the difficulty of predicting whether extremists will turn dangerous. The assault was the third attack in three months in which most of the assailants had been on authorities' radar at some point.As the investigation expanded to look at how the men knew one another and whether they were part of a larger conspiracy, Pakistani intelligence authorities swooped Tuesday into the town of Jhelum, where Khurum Butt lived until the time he was 7, when he moved to Britain. His cousin, 18-year-old Bilal Dar, told The Associated Press that Butt's uncle was taken in for questioning. It was unclear if he was detained.\"Our family is hurt by what he did,\" Dar said in the town about two hours east of Pakistan's capital.",

The ICC report said that a number of players and support staff in the domestic set-ups of the Test and ODI countries are either unwilling or unable to comply with the protocols.The report said that in some instances, players have not been able to meet the support staff in person, as the support staff are limited to one-on-one interaction with the players. While the Test players have to remain in isolation in a hotel room while the ODI players have to stay in single rooms while staying on the ground.The players have also not been able to maintain physical distance from each other.The report mentioned that there is a lack of cooperation between the teams and the players themselves about the use of the Covid-19 protocols.The report said that the players have been unable to adapt to the Covid-19 protocols and have continued to break them by playing each other's matches.\"These actions have, in some instances, put players at immediate risk,\" said the report.It also mentioned that the players' behaviour has not helped in creating a good atmosphere at the nets for the teams. The ICC chief executive Manu Sawhney has had a number of meetings with the players but it is reported that players still fail to follow the Covid-19 protocols and the ICC is left with no other option but to impose sanctions.The ICC report said that there are some areas in which some of the players can do well to improve their behaviour. For example, some players have to adhere to the Covid-19 protocols even when they feel they are not being treated fairly. The ICC further urged the players to take care of their families, especially their elderly parents, and to ensure proper diet in their respective homes.The ICC chief executive also suggested that players could start getting back to playing the T20 games to help the team achieve its target of the World Cup 2022.",

No single party will get a majority; the Socialist party of outgoing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is leading the race; and there will be lawmakers from the far-right Vox party.Beyond that, the result is too close to call.Spanish Prime Minister and Socialist Party candidate Pedro Sanchez, center, smiles for a photo during an election campaign event in Toledo, central Spain, April 26, 2019.

With just two albums behind them, \"True Blue\" earned a No. 1 spot on the Americana music charts, and now they have their eyes on a fourth No. 1 with \"Love Is Just What It Is.\"The album was recorded at the legendary Mountain Top Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. It was produced by Jason Isbell (brother of country music legend Willie), along with Jody Gibson and Ben Gibson.From the first notes of the album's title track, \"Love Is Just What It Is,\" it is clear that the band has crafted a song as personal as its subject. This single is a moving tribute to the loss of his brother, who was killed in a traffic accident.With the new album, the Gibson Brothers have put the pedal to the metal and delivered a strong new song to their fanbase, as well as to those who have followed the band since its inception in 1996. \"Love Is Just What It Is\" is a strong follow-up to their best-selling album, \"True Blue.\"The four-piece group consists of J.D. Gibson on vocals, Ben Gibson on guitar, Ben Gibson on bass, and J.D. Gibson on lead and backup vocals. The original line-up of Ben and J.D. Gibson formed in 2002 as the Gibson Brothers, and they have shared the stage with artists such as Eric Clapton, John Mellencamp, and Paul Simon.At the same time, J.D. Gibson's songwriting and music business talents are at the forefront of the music industry. In 2007, he produced and mixed the album of the same name for country music legend Tim McGraw, \"Tim McGraw.\" And in 2011, Gibson's production team and band (the Gipson Brothers) won a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration.J.D.

The rural vote appears as divided as it is elsewhere.As Egyptians await the results of their first truly open presidential election, fault lines between Islamists and old guard secularists appear to cut across the nation. In the village of Kafr Kandil, south of Cairo, the choice plays well with the largely conservative rural vote: some seek stability in religion, others in past performance. Many of the latter look to veteran diplomat Amr Moussa, who along with former Air Force chief Ahmed Shafik, promises a return to pre-uprising law and order, minus the corruption. Outside the village school, which is serving as the village polling station, Shadia Ewis, a housewife and mother of five, hopes Moussa wins. She thinks he's a \"respectable man\" who \"could control the country.\" Her friend and fellow housewife, Magda Hassan, agrees. She says she wants Moussa to institute reforms, so that it won't be like it was under the old government, when everything was exploited.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union says its Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians is investigating the cases of 311 MPs from 41 countries - a 13 percent increase over 2013.The data reveal 38 percent of the MPs who faced governmental abuse are from Africa, 25 percent from Asia, 18 percent from the Middle East and North Africa, 14 percent from the Americas and five percent from Europe.IPU human rights program manager Rogier Huizenga said the three worst cases in Africa were Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Eritrea. They represent 21.5 percent of abuse cases on the continent.“DRC - there are a number of serious cases where due process is a concern, where freedom of expression is a concern. Eritrea is the famous case of the G-11, the members of parliament who wrote a critical letter to the authorities, to the president, Afwerki, 2001, and were taken away in September that year and were never seen again. And, then the case in Zambia where there are concerns about the use of the Public Order Act and the limitations that that brings along for the right to freedom of assembly,” said Huizenga.In Asia, the IPU cites 78 MPs from 12 countries who are under threat.It singles out the Maldives as the worst violator.",

As hundreds more remain camped out in Taiwan’s parliament, the government weighs what to do next. About 2,000 police officers expelled hundreds of protesters from Taiwan’s guarded cabinet offices before dawn on Monday. The government mobilized riot squads and water cannons to oust demonstrators in a five-hour struggle. Protesters want to stop quick approval of the trade deal, calling that approach risky as China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and wants political reunification. Lin Nan-hsin, a 20-year-old protester from a university in central Taiwan, was among those expelled by police. He said there are two camps of protesters, one that advocates peace and the other that prefers a more extreme form of protest as the only way of getting the government’s attention. Lin said that in the end, there was a discussion with the lead protest planners about whether to break into the cabinet complex and finally a go-ahead was given. Taiwan and China signed a service trade pact in June following several other trade and investment agreements reached since 2008.",

Trump brought 52 business leaders from New York City to the White House Tuesday to talk about another favorite campaign issue — infrastructure and economic growth. The U.S. economy has so far proven to be a point of pride for a presidency that has otherwise gotten off to a rocky start. Trump inherited a stable economy from former President Barack Obama, an economic recovery that's heading toward its eighth year. But Trump believes he can do more for business. Trump and several of his top aides emphasized plans to cut red tape and jumpstart infrastructure projects at Tuesday's meeting, while also previewing for the CEOs other priorities that include shortening flight times for airplanes, increasing the power grid's efficiency and targeting programs to improve job training. At one point the president had an aide come on stage to hold up a long scroll of the government's approval process for building a highway. The president then pledged to eliminate more than 90 percent of the regulations involved and \"still have safety.'' He provided no details. The administration has committed to directing as much as $1 trillion for infrastructure over the next decade, although it has yet to release policy specifics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently said she expects a plan will be unveiled later this year. But getting a measure through Congress could be difficult given the Republican majority in both chambers and their desire to reduce tax rates as much as possible.",

Some said their action was retaliation for the decision of the top court to reduce the salary of teachers by half during one of the biggest waves of anti-government protests in the country’s history.The protesters chanted the term “el hombre al que esta perdido,” or “the man who fell asleep” in reference to the five Supreme Court justices.“I want you to understand this,” Venezuelan lawyer Edgar Zambrano said in video filmed by the prosecutor. “This is not a joke. You and your fellow magistrates were complicit in the killing of two people, in the face of international support.

After having had a stroke (I assume it happened during an \"aftermath\" of the stroke, at least in my case), I found myself struggling and looking for the time to do more.I didn't understand why this was so hard to do so I started to research and found out that when you do lots of things and you have a stroke, it is not as if you can just do all at once. It is necessary to do things gradually and do them in stages one at a time. A lot of things I had previously thought did not actually take place because they involved several things and I just never connected all the dots.If you have had a stroke and know for sure that you can't go to all the places you need to go or do all the things you need to do in one go, then you need to find someone who can help you to do the most difficult or time consuming things. It takes more than the amount of time you normally would be able to accomplish. In my case, I did need a lot of help to do the things I needed to do but the amount of time that had to be spent helped by the experience of having had a stroke. It is like being a child again. The more experiences that I had, the clearer and more comfortable I was with all of the problems and I was able to do more tasks to accomplish them.We do need to take the time to do a lot of things but that also means that the time we need to spend doing these things is not as long as before we had a stroke. The more experiences we have the more quickly we can adapt to changes and to the new challenges we face.A year after my stroke I was able to do many of the things I had been trying to do for months before.",

It?s a real public park,\" screamed a protester.This impassioned Occupy Wall Street protester recently denounced New York police as bullies for enforcing a regulation that limits the size of signs in public parks. At issue was this long banner. Protesters say the regulation applies to commercial vendors, not public expression.The standoff took place Wednesday in Union Square Park, after police forcibly dispersed an attempt by protesters a few days earlier to reoccupy Zuccotti Park, about three kilometers away, where the Occupy movement began last September.Sherman Jackson, an Occupy media representative, says confrontations with police over territory draw media focus away from the movement?s core message of corporate greed and income inequality. Jackson says he defers to those who support a physical presence, but thinks it is not necessary.?The fact is that we use social media, we use Twitter, we use Facebook, we e-mail, we text one another, and we can muster a couple of thousand people within an hour to gather at any spot that we ask them to gather at,\" said Jackson.Protester and saxophonist Dave Intrator says a physical presence is essential.

According to the United Nation’s Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Nigeria’s National Population Bureau reported that of all the females aged 15 years old in Nigeria, 5,898 were adolescent-pregnant during 2008-11; which represented 6 percent of all female births in the country. A report released by the University of Jos has shown that over 60 per cent of the teenage pregnancies in the country are caused by unplanned pregnancies. This means that 60 per cent of those who become pregnant during early age are the poorest and most vulnerable.In this report entitled “The Unplanned Pregnancy Epidemic in Nigeria”, UNICEF Nigeria Country Representative (CR) Madam Jovita Ngozi says that in terms of access to family planning services, about 2 million of those who could benefit from those services do not receive them. The findings show that over the same period, there was about an 85 percent increase in the number of unplanned pregnancies in the country. Over 95 per cent of the unplanned pregnancies in the country during the same period involved the teenage aged population.More than half of all the teenagers in the country are from rural areas, especially from the western part of Nigeria. Although most of the urban children are educated and have access to contraceptives, these studies have shown that over two thirds of the rural girls (more than 60 per cent) and 90 per cent of the rural boys are uneducated. They cannot access the services they need and these may lead to unnecessary pregnancy. These girls may experience problems like infertility, loss of social status and physical disability or disability through such pregnancy. These problems are life threatening in the most vulnerable group in Nigeria and constitute a substantial health and human development burden.The report further revealed that some of these girls and boys may also face sexual abuse and violence during and after the pregnancy.",

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\"Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \"schizoid policy making.\"Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \"a horrifically chilling signal\" that \"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\"On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies.",

Large scale cyber assaults against Chechnya and Georgia preceded Russia's military actions there.The open nature of the Internet and its use by governments and business make it a rich target for an enemy attacks.

The Constitutional Court upheld the election results.Nikol Pashinyan, an opposition activist at the time who was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests, was elected prime minister by parliament on May 8 this year.Kocharyan said the latest charges were politically motivated, but added he was ready to spend time in prison.\"These charges are fiction, fabricated, unjustified and have a political implication,\" he told an independent Armenian Yerkir Media TV.Kocharyan also said the most likely development was his arrest, but he did not intend to run away.\"",

Russian police raided the apartments of top opposition leaders in Moscow on Monday, the day before a mass rally is to take place against President Putin.

Staged the day before Putin's May 7 presidential inauguration, that rally ended in violence with 20 policemen injured and 436 protesters detained. Democratic Russia Committee Director Natalia Pelevine says the raids were designed to intimidate opposition leaders and their supporters. \"They are trying to confiscate electronic equipment, probably computers and DVDs and any device that can hold information pretty much. We know they are confiscating that at this moment,\" Pelevine said. In the raids, police beat down the doors of two of the best known leaders of the younger generation of democracy protesters, internet blogger Alexei Navalny and television hostess Ksenia Sobchak. Later, a police source told Interfax that police confiscated nearly $1,900,000 from Sobchak's apartment. Sobchak tweeted of the raid: \"People burst in at 8 o'clock in the morning, they were stopping me from putting my clothes on. They robbed the apartment.

The verdict by the Warsaw Provincial Court was the first conviction in the April 10, 2010, crash of Poland's presidential plane in Smolensk, Russia. The first lady, army commanders, central bank head and other top state officials were also killed in the crash. Gen. Pawel Bielawny was found guilty of knowingly neglecting his duties and exposing Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk to danger by failing to order a proper inspection of the rudimentary Smolensk airport and, in the president's case, failing to send experienced officers to await the plane's landing. Tusk had landed safely three days earlier at the same airport. The court said it was a mistake of the organizers to have chosen an almost unused airport as a landing place for top state officials. The former deputy head of the Government Protection Bureau, or BOR, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 10,000-zloty (2,270-euro) fine. The verdict is subject to appeal. Kaczynski's plane crashed in dense fog on approach to Smolensk airport. Separate commissions of aviation experts in Poland and in Russia blamed the crash on insufficient training of the crew and on human error in adverse circumstances. Tusk's landing was in good visibility, but the court also saw security shortcomings in the organization of his flight. Poland is currently governed by the conservative Law and Justice party led by Kaczynski's twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is intent on finding and punishing those guilty of his brother's death.",

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo followed up talks with Dimitrov by expressing strong support for the deal, signed this summer, in which Macedonia agreed to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. Greece and Macedonia have been feuding over who gets to use the name since Macedonia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
