        "text": "in the UK, EU, Afghanistan, and PakistanThe British government’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office recently released data showing a number of foreign spies suspected of having breached UK government surveillance systems may not be the only perpetrators. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) released data showing that in addition to an already known list of British spies with high-risk intelligence, a total of 12 suspected terrorists have been questioned by British security services with information suggesting that they may have also accessed UK systems that are being monitored by the NSA. These suspects include:• A “person of interest” in a 2007 shooting at the London Stock Exchange that resulted in four fatalities, and one police officer being seriously injured.• The former chief of Pakistan’s national intelligence agency, who reportedly fled to the US in 2009 after being questioned by UK intelligence about his role in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.• Pakistani-born suspect Abdul Hafiz, who had reportedly traveled to the UK under false pretenses, and was questioned by the OSS in late 2006 in the case of an alleged plot to kill a British soldier.• Abdul Rahman, a suspect in the murder of a police officer that took place the following year, who was questioned by the UK security service (CIS) after being “identified as a possible suspect in the death of Detective Constable David James,” who had been involved in the investigation into the death of two men who were murdered in a suspected murder-for-hire plot.• A suspect in the 2006 murder of a police officer, who was reportedly involved in the investigation into the case and who was questioned by the CIS.In addition, the British government revealed that in an effort to protect UK spy targets, intelligence sources were sent overseas to question suspects. In the UK, for instance, intelligence sources were sent to the US to question suspects linked to the 2007 London Stock Exchange shooting. In the US, the same sources were flown to Pakistan to question suspects associated with a 2006 “plot to murder a British soldier at a NATO base in the country,” though the source of the attack remains a mystery. In some cases, the source of the attack has still not been identified.The information released by the British government to the OSS shows that a number of the suspects were under suspicion but that some have not been arrested.",

He is going to be very worried about that. I don’t know how that will go. But I think that the US military is probably going to want to be very close to the base if Kim Jong Un tries something. That would probably be the end of the strategy of getting to Pyongyang.I think that the US would prefer to see an economic relationship, and that would also be something that we do have.The analyst thinks that any US military action against North Korea would probably lead to another attack by North Korea.And he warns that Kim Jong Un would have no choice but to invade South Korea if the US does anything to him.So I think that the US strategy will be to get as close as they can to South Korea. That will probably be to the port in Pyeongchang. I don’t know how that will go but that is part of the plan.But I think that the US and other nations should probably look at a range of diplomatic techniques, including military ones, in order to make sure that Kim Jong Un’s regime doesn’t have the capacity to launch a nuclear strike against its neighbours.North Korea may not be using nuclear weapons against US forces in the near future, but the chances of its regime going nuclear are rising every day.This could lead to Kim Jong Un trying to build nuclear weapons that have a greater effect than conventional weapons.",

He said it was because Muslims are not allowed to enter during prayers.The incident came a day after police officers escorted a Jewish man into a synagogue and allowed him inside.There have been multiple incidents in recent weeks where Muslim-majority mosques have barred men from attending services.The New York police department said Friday that the man who was refused entry at the mosque has a complaint pending with it. The police department declined to provide further information.The incident is not a national problem. There are no major mosques in the United States that have barred men from attendance in recent years, and there is no report of incidents in which men have been turned away because they are Jewish.But there have been several incidents in which groups of Muslims have attacked and defaced Jewish symbols in response to such incidents.There have been multiple incidents in recent weeks where Muslim-majority mosques have barred men from attending services.",

This request was submitted as a statement of Nigeria's intention to take action against atrocities by Boko Haram. Nigeria's actions are in response to a letter of request sent to the ICC by the U.S. State Department in 2014.Amnesty International's request for action against crimes committed by Boko Haram is an important step in the ongoing struggle to end crimes against humanity perpetrated by Boko Haram.Boko Haram is responsible for committing atrocities on a horrific scale against civilians in Nigeria's Sambisa Forest, where over 250,000 people were displaced and some 300,000 people have fled their homes. The Sambisa Forest has been declared as a humanitarian crisis because its nature, scale and magnitude of destruction make it difficult to provide food for all displaced people in need.The Sambisa Forest has been subjected to extensive destruction, including the destruction of more than half a million trees and a significant number of animal farms in order to ensure Boko Haram's operational activities.Amnesty International is concerned that it is now increasingly clear that many of these crimes were committed at the hands of armed groups who use the forest to carry out their operations and have caused serious humanitarian concern for the people living in and near the forest.The situation calls for a full investigation into these crimes, which would enable full accountability and accountability for those responsible. The United States of America also needs to take action to ensure that the crimes committed by these armed groups are fully investigated and properly punished.Boko Haram's brutal persecution of thousands of people for the crime of trying to leave the Sambisa Forest and return to their homes, is an urgent humanitarian issue in need of urgent attention. This attack should serve as a call for an international investigation into the Sambisa Forest crimes committed by Boko Haram and a call to the ICC to prosecute war criminals.In a letter to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on 2 December 2017, Nigeria's Justice Minister, and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, confirmed Nigeria's intention to take action against atrocities committed by Boko Haram.It is now time for the ICC to initiate an investigation and to fully investigate the crimes committed in Sambisa Forest.",

(File Image)BANGKOK, Thailand, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's win in a general election on Sunday could trigger a power struggle within the ruling alliance that could split the main opposition parties, analysts said.Prayuth's election victory has raised hopes among his supporters of restoring Thai democracy, but those hopes could also lead to conflict between his two main rival parties, the Future Forward party led by former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, and an opposition alliance led by former Deputy PM Prasit Doophanop, both of whom have said they are prepared to sit together in a new Thai-led government.Prayuth's party won 35% of the vote, just shy of the 38% needed for a simple majority in parliament and a parliamentary majority to enact laws, but both the Future Forward and Prasit parties have been under pressure to sit together in a new government after both parties won more than 10% of the vote in a separate national survey.But Prasit and Future Forward, whose supporters have demanded an immediate power-sharing agreement, have so far stuck with their pledge of holding \"pre-vote consultations\" to discuss which party or candidates to support in future elections.Future Forward said in a statement it was prepared to \"agree or disagree\" with any political party, but said it would not sit with a \"fascist regime\" and urged the public to rally on Sunday in support of the party and the government.\"If Prayuth's party is accepted by both Prasit's party and Future Forward's party in a government, the future is very bright,\" said Somsak Setboonach, political science lecturer at Thammasat University.\"However, this will be difficult if the Future Forward party and Prasit's party fail to work together as one government, as both parties will have different interests and views on future politics.\"Thammasat University Political Science Professor Chotisol Tatsirasri said that Prasit and Future Forward had similar aims and would work for an independent administration in a post-war Thailand.But he added that the two parties had different strategies to achieve the goal.\"",

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) questioned the nominee on the definition of judicial activism, and asked whether she had spoken to the Boston Tea Party, and whether her father had worked as a barber in a public housing project. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) asked about the \"prejudice\" of President Obama, his wife Michelle, and his daughters Malia, 13, and Sasha, 11, referring to the former president's family vacation to Martha's Vineyard in 2012. Sotomayor's answers to his questions will likely be read as the first indications of how her supporters and detractors will interpret her. In response to a question from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sotomayor responded that the Obama administration has violated the Constitution's pledge to be a \"charity\" in the form of the government's welfare programs, and that \"it is shameful and wrong to reward political cronies by expanding their welfare rolls.\" Asked by Paul if he would vote for Sotomayor for the Supreme Court, the nominee said that she would.

For the past several years, the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan was primarily centered around counter-terrorism and military presence. But since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in April, U.S. military strategy has changed. It has shifted toward countering the Taliban, especially in the south.In a video released last week by Army Maj. Gen. Chris Donahue, deputy director of the U.S. military's Center for International Communication, he lays out some of the issues and challenges that American forces will face during their operations in Pakistan.Among these, Donahue lays out the need for U.S. forces to train Afghan forces to fight off the Taliban insurgency and to provide a military solution that includes economic development as an option for the Afghan people. In his views, the Taliban is not a nation. Instead, he believes that what Pakistan needs is the creation of a stable, democratic, and prosperous nation.\"We will use the same strategy we have used in South Africa. [It is] to promote stability, to assist the people in Afghanistan, and to have a stable and peaceful region. It will not be about 'taking out' the Taliban, but it will be about'making Pakistan work, make Pakistan a better nation and a safer nation.' And that's what we will be doing,\" Donahue says in the video.It will not be about \"taking out\" the Taliban, but it will be about \"making Pakistan work, make Pakistan a better nation and a safer nation,\" he added.Earlier in his speech, Donahue said that Pakistan's security and economic problems stem from its foreign policy of supporting Islamist groups who don't believe in democracy and are hostile to the United States and NATO.\"",

The Hindu nationalist leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his role in sectarian violence which swept his state in 2002. Television pictures showed U.S. Ambassador to India Nancy Powell and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi exchanging a cordial handshake before they sat down for discussions Thursday in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state headed by the Indian opposition leader. Political analysts said the handshake was prompted by the possibility that Modi could head India’s next government. He is the prime ministerial candidate of the opposition B.J.P., which polls show could dislodge the Congress party in upcoming national elections, to be held by May. The U.S. was among several countries which shunned the B.J.P. leader over allegations that he did not do enough to stop riots which swept through Gujarat in 2002 and killed nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi denies the accusations. The Supreme Court has found no evidence to prosecute him. As he grew in prominence on India’s national political stage in the last year, other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and Australia, restored ties with him.
